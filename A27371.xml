            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THere are no States nor Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, but, at ſome time or other, have felt the dreadful Effects of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, which, under the ſpecious Cloak of Reformation in Religion, have been ſtirred up and fomented by the Turbulent Spirits of Wicked Ambitious men; and though our <hi>Europe</hi> can ſufficiently ſupply us with uſeful Examples of the ſame, yet it is not to be fixed wholly to that little Corner of the World; all Countries that the Sun enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62018:7"/>have ſhared in thoſe general Calamities; amongſt which, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire will at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent furniſh us with a Story.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, which is ſingular in that vaſt Empire, is not without Diviſions into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sects, of which the principal is that of a great Prophet amongſt them, named <hi>Haly,</hi> which was at firſt the ſame with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but ſince, through the Ambition Pride, and Luxury of its Prieſts, ſo alter'd and diſguis'd, by the introduction of an Idolatrous, Impertinent, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous way of Worſhip, that there is not ſo much left in it, as its true Name; for the Followers of it ſcorn to call it after its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Name, but diſtinguiſh it from their true Ancient Religion of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> by the name of <hi>Haly</hi>'s U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Religion.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Innovations were the Cauſe that a ſelect number of the true <hi>Mahometans,</hi> ſeeing ſo many
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62018:7"/>Superſtitious Ceremonies daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd into the outward worſhip, and ſo much Idolatry in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of their Religion, and every Age ſtill adding new Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to that new ſuperſtructure, did withdraw themſelves from thoſe ſo groſs and palpable Affronts which were daily offer'd unto the Deity, by taking from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the Honour and Glory, which of all right and due doth only, and wholly appertain to him, to give to his Creature; and they worſhipped their God by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in Holineſs of Life, and Purity of Doctrine, proteſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe Innovations which had been foiſted in, by the proud Prieſts of the Sect of <hi>Haly.</hi> For which, the Prieſts of <hi>Haly</hi>'s Sect were not wanting in all their Arts, to caſt dirt on the true Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans; they proclaim'd them Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, Hereticks, Doggs, and perſecuted them in all places with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62018:8"/>Fire and Sword, declaring that they deſerv'd a worſe Uſage yet, for having ſeparated themſelves from the Body of the Church; while they themſelves were the perſons that had diſtanc'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and fallen off from the true Mahometan Religion, by their prodigious addition of new Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not becoming any ſober, true Religion, while that thoſe which they ſo much calumniated, were the true Obſervers of the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Religion, which they ſtill follow'd, and had only ſeparated themſelves from the Innovations of the <hi>Haliſts,</hi> to avoid offering of thoſe great Injuries to their God, which ſo Idolatrous a Guilt as the <hi>Haliſts</hi> did practice, would have oblig'd them to do.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Perſians,</hi> who had more generally embraced the corrupt Sect of <hi>Haly</hi> than the <hi>Turks</hi> had, were more numerous and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the true Mahometans, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62018:8"/>their Emperors were ſuch Zealous Maintainers of it, that, as their preſent Emperor has declar'd, they had deſign'd long ſince to root out of their Dominions the <hi>Mahometan Religion,</hi> but that the State Affairs would not till his time admit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But he being wholly govern'd by the moſt wicked order of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd their advice, and began by the murther of his own Subjects, of the true <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, that Univerſal Reduction to <hi>Haly</hi>'s Sect, of all the true <hi>Mahometans,</hi> which he pretended to accompliſh.</p>
                  <p>In that he has outdone all his Predeceſſors, for they contented themſelves with retrenching little by little, the Authority which Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts (as they call'd the true <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi>) had obtain'd, together with the Priviledges and Liberty which they enjoy'd in their own Empire, and in ſending into the

                     <hi>Selim,</hi> the firſt <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor of that Name, who had Married a Daughter of a <hi>Perſian</hi> Emperor, of the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> did dreadfully feel the effects of the Diviſions which thoſe wicked Mahometiſts had ſow'd amongſt his People. For a certain ſort of diſaffected Men to the Government both in Church and State, under the pretence of Reformation in both, rais'd Arms and Rebell'd againſt their lawful Emperor, took him Priſoner, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd him, and choſe the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> to be their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62018:9"/>after they had caus'd the <hi>Sultana</hi> and her three Sons, <hi>Selim</hi> the Second, <hi>Amurat</hi> and <hi>Oſman,</hi> to flye from their Cruelty into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi> Where ſhe attempted by the ſolicitation of the <hi>Mahometiſts,</hi> to have her Children (who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been brought up by <hi>Selim</hi>'s particular Care in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, in which he himſelf had liv'd and dy'd) to be brought over to her own Perſwaſion, which being come to <hi>Selim</hi> the Second's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he got from her his youngeſt Brother, which he ſecured under good hands, but ſhe retain'd <hi>Amurat,</hi> which by that means was brought up in the Sect of <hi>Haly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Turks</hi> had liv'd ſome years under divers ſorts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, ſtill finding themſelves, as oft as they chang'd of Form of Government, after the Death of him they had choſe Protector, in a worſe condition than they were under the Reigns of their lawful
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62018:10"/>Emperor, they recalled back <hi>Selim</hi> the Second from his Exile; he and his two Brothers were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the whole Empire, with all the Expreſſions of Joy imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he was ſeated on his Throne, Crown'd, and even Ador'd by his People.</p>
                  <p>Of Truth, never was Prince, except his Father, Endow'd with ſo much Goodneſs and Mildneſs, mixt with Majeſty and Greatneſs of Soul. He had not been long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed in his Dominions, but that, through the ſollicitation of his people, who earneſtly deſired to be govern'd by an Off-ſpring of ſo good a Prince, he Marryed a Foreign Princeſs, of the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind as himſelf, though an <hi>Haliſt,</hi> by whom he had no Iſſue.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> the then Emperor of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who had fill'd <hi>Selim</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with all ſorts of Orders of the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> eſpecially of the <hi>Mahometiſts,</hi> who were like ſo many Spies in <hi>Selim</hi>'s Court, was inform'd amongſt the reſt of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim</hi>'s Amorous Diſpoſition, to which Inclination he gave the more ſcope, for want of Children by his <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> to paſs his time with. There was ſent over to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, a <hi>Perſian</hi> Woman, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently handſome, of a mean Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, a great Zealot of the Sect of <hi>Haly;</hi> with full inſtructions how to gain <hi>Selim</hi>'s Affections, and when that was done, how to govern him, get from him a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knowledge of all the moſt private Conſultations and Deſigns
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62018:11"/>of the State, and to influence him in all his undertakings; ſhe ſoon got ſo much the maſtery over <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim</hi>'s Heart, that through her means, all the ſecrets of the Port were known in <hi>Perſia,</hi> according to which, <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> and his <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Counſel, did take ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as did ſtill tend towards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing that great work, of extirpation of Hereſie (as they ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it) which had been ſo long contriving.</p>
                  <p>It was thought that the quickeſt way would be, in getting <hi>Selim</hi> to forſake the Religion he was brought up in, and to bring him over to the Sect of <hi>Haly:</hi> very particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were given to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to his <hi>Perſian</hi> Miſtreſs, whom he lov'd the more, becauſe ſhe had brought him forth ſome Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which were the Darlings of <hi>Selim</hi>'s Heart. She together with others of that Faction in the Court, did uſe all their Indeavours to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62018:11"/>bring that great work about, and finding him ſo firm and ſtedfaſt to his Principles in Religion, as not in the leaſt to yield to their Solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>Cha-Abas,</hi> with his wicked Counſel, thought it fit to remove him from the Throne, to make room for his Brother <hi>Amurat,</hi> who as you have already heard, was very zealous to the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> and did privately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it.</p>
                  <p>All things being fitted in Church and State for that great Change, upon which depended the entire and univerſal deſtruction, of the true Antient Orthodox <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, ſo long before deſign'd, and privately whiſper'd about, and which could never be accompliſh'd, till the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, as it was particularly exercis'd in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, were firſt ruin'd. There was a deſign fram'd of Murthering the <hi>Sultan,</hi> of ſending over a <hi>Perſian</hi> Army, all of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62018:12"/>Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> of ſending Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to all the Nobility, that were of the Sect of <hi>Haly</hi> in <hi>Selim</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and in fine, of ſetting up <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat</hi> to be <hi>Sultan,</hi> who ſhould aid to bring in the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> and by his Power and Authority maintain it, and ſhould declare himſelf of that Sect, and the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of it.</p>
                  <p>The Storm was ready to break and fall upon the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire from <hi>Perſia,</hi> when the Plot was diſcover'd, the Grand Council of the <hi>Divan</hi> being Summoned, they took the buſineſs into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſifted it to the bottom, and found out all the contrivances, the Conſpirators, and their Abettors; all thoſe that could be ſeiz'd at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and elſewhere in the Empire, were put in Priſon, Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd. Convicted by Authentick and undeniable Evidences, to be guilty of the Enterpriſe, which being againſt the Laws of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62018:12"/>they ſuffered the Condign Puniſhment which the ſaid Laws had order'd to be inflicted on ſuch Notorious Criminals; after which, all the Prieſts of the Sect of <hi>Haly</hi> were ſeiz'd, that could be taken; and according to a Statute of the Empire, whereby they are declar'd Traytors, divers of them receiv'd the due Reward of ſuch Villainous Enterpriſes, which they had made againſt the <hi>Sultan</hi> and the Empire. And all thoſe in the Empire, of what degree and condition ſoever, that were of the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> were diveſted from all Publick Offices or Employes, incapacitated for the future, from having any Sway, or bearing any Offices either Civil or Military, baniſhed from Court, and commanded to remain at twenty Miles diſtance from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> on great Penalties.</p>
                  <p>Thus that great ſtorm, which ſo ſeverely threatned the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, was

But <hi>Selim</hi>'s tender Love and Affection to his Brother <hi>Amurat,</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver permit him to give his conſent to it, ſo that it was not done.</p>
                  <p>Things were in this poſture, when <hi>Roxana,</hi> of whom we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rehearſe the Story, began to appear in the World, with all thoſe Charms, which made her as many Slaves as ſhe had of Spectators.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62018:13"/>
                  <p>She was Daughter to <hi>Aladin,</hi> the Seraquiere or Lord Lieutenant of a Province, a Perſon of a Noble Extraction, very Wealthy and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, and of the Sect of <hi>Haly:</hi> She was Endow'd by Nature with all the Perfections, which could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh a Perſon of about eighteen or nineteen years of Age, and ſhe had receiv'd an Education propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to her Birth and Beauty. Her Father, who perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ways of the Court, thought it his beſt courſe, in order to preſerve his Fair Daughter from the cenſure of the World, to keep her as far as he could from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and to diſpoſe of her in Marriage to ſome Worthy Perſon, ſuitable to her Quality, and that great Portion which he deſign'd her.</p>
                  <p>But his Wife, being of another mind, and very deſirous to ſee the Court, did watch but for a time to go thither, and to bring her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62018:14"/>Daughter <hi>Roxana</hi> along with her. She was not long without a fair occaſion for that purpoſe. Her Siſter Marrying of her Daughter there, to a perſon who had a very conſiderable Employ at the Port. The earneſt Invitation which they received from her Siſter, to honour them with their preſence, and ſome occaſion which did call upon <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> to give his attendance at the Port about that time upon earneſt buſineſs; made them to take hold of this Opportunity, ſo that they all came to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where <hi>Aladin</hi> had a very ſtately Palace of his own.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before <hi>Roxana's</hi> Beauty was blaz'd all about <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> even within the Gates of the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> amongſt thoſe who had had the happy Opportunity of ſeeing this Beauty, one who was the Son of a <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and who had an Houſe in another Street, whoſe Wall joined to the end of <hi>Aladin's</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62018:14"/>Garden, was the moſt paſſionate of all her Lovers. He had contriv'd ſo cunningly, a hole in the Stone Wall, which anſwer'd to <hi>Aladin's</hi> Garden, that it could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, it being ſo ſmall in <hi>Aladin's</hi> Garden, and large enough in <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him's</hi> Garden (ſo was the Lover call'd) to put his Head in ſo, that he could almoſt ſee all over that part of the Garden, that was next to that Walk. He had heard of <hi>Raxana's</hi> Beauty, which had made him deſirous to ſee whether her Face did anſwer that Fame which was ſpread of her, and having learn'd that all the Air that ſhe took, was in the Walks of her Garden, which was not overlook'd from any houſe, but her Fathers; and that neither himſelf, nor any body elſe had lived in his Houſe, ſince the death of his Father, therefore he hoped to gratifie his earneſt deſires and curioſity.</p>
                  <p>He wanted not of opportunity of ſeeing <hi>Roxana,</hi> for ſhe delighting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62018:15"/>in Cultivating of Flowers, did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly towards the Cool of the Evening walk in the Garden, and look after her Plants; one day, a ſudden ſhower of Rain falling, ſhe was forc'd to retire into a little Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Houſe, where, ſitting down, ſhe began to entertain her ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To which, <hi>Roxana replyed,</hi> that for her part ſhe could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect him, and then began to ſpeak of a man as ſhe would like, and that ſhe could Love. Her maid ſaid, <hi>that ſuch a man was not to be found in Nature;</hi> to which ſhe replyed again, <hi>that ſhe would have ſuch a one or none, and that ſhe would ſtay till ſhe found ſuch a one.</hi> This diſcourſe was clearly overheard by <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who had then cauſe to admire her
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62018:15"/>Wit, as well as her Beauty; of a truth he was ſo taken with both, that he reſolved upon a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Love, which he thought ought firſt to be uſhered in by asking of her Parents Conſent, and immediately he ſet ſome of his Friends about it, but his Suit was ſo rejected by the Father, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to marry her in his own Province, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> thought it needleſs to apply himſelf any longer to her Parents, but reſolved to endeavour the gaining of her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by all the means imaginable; but how to come to the ſpeech of her, or by what means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey his thoughts to her, was the buſineſs. After divers thoughts on that point, he thought it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to uſher in his declaration by ſome pieces of Services, ſuch as he ſhould be capable of performing, and which he ſhould think would pleaſe her beſt.</p>
                  <p>He had not been above two or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62018:16"/>three days in Town ſince the death of his Father which was above two years before, and having ſcarce been ſeen at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he gave out to thoſe few Friends which he had viſited, that a buſineſs of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which he was to accompliſh, in the Country, and which had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned his coming to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> calling for him in haſte back, he would be immediately gon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; after which having taken leave of them, and gone with his People out of Town a little way, he ſent them all to his Country Houſe, under the care of his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, only retaining with him one Slave, who was his Gardner, in whom he had repoſed very great Confidence. He had lain at a Friends Houſe thoſe two days he had been in Town, ſo that the Gates of his Houſe having not at all been open'd, in the Night he return'd into the Town, where being come, he ſent his Slave <hi>Moretto</hi> to get in ſuch
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62018:16"/>things as he ſhould neceſſarily want, and to bring them to him the next Night at the deadeſt time of it, and that he ſhould take a ſpecial care of not being ſeen, when he came into the Houſe by the ſtable door. After having given theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to his Servant, who was an abſolute Stranger in the City, he got privately into his Houſe, and having found in the Garden houſe ſome Tools, he fell to work, in making a hole in the Garden Wall, through which he might Peep, and behold his inviſible Miſtreſs. It was through that Hole, that he had beheld her, and heard her ſpeak; he obſerved how ſhe ordered her Flowers and Plants, and once he heard her ſay to her Maid, they would do much better, if they were removed in the empty Bed, which was on the other ſide of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and that if they were Water'd early in the Morning, they would thrive much better; but that ſhe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62018:17"/>and her Maid were both too laſie to riſe ſo early, and that ſhe would not truſt the care of thoſe Plants to any but her ſelf, that when they were come to Perfection, they might owe the whole obligation of their being to her own hands and Care, and that ſhe might take the greater delight in the uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Ibrahim</hi> took upon himſelf, as if his Miſtreſs had ſpoken par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to him, he therefore takes the Reſolution in the dead of the Night, to get over the Wall into her Garden, and there perform all that ſhe had mentioned to her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but becauſe he thought the work might be too much for one pair of hands to perform in ſome few hours, he commanded <hi>Moretto</hi> to follow him. They got over the Wall, and the firſt thing they did, was to gather up every the leaſt bit of Rubbiſh which might have dropp'd at their coming over, which put him in mind alſo to go towards
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62018:17"/>the place where the hole was made, and examine how that ſtood, he found much Rubbiſh fallen there, but ſome Weeds growing high and thick in that place, as being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of the way, they did hide them: however, for fear of any diſcovery, when thoſe Weeds ſhould be cut down, he caus'd <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto</hi> to gather them all up, and fill his Pockets with them, while he himſelf took care to hide the hole under a large Leaf, which he might eaſily at any time remove to the one ſide, with a little green Sprig.</p>
                  <p>This done, they immediately fell to work, <hi>Moretto</hi> dug up the Roots, and brought them to <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> and he ſet them again in the other place; when they were all remov'd, he water'd them very well, out of a Ciſtern which was near the little Summer Houſe, in which he had laſt ſeen <hi>Roxana;</hi> while <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto</hi> was employ'd in ſmoothing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62018:18"/>up the old Bed, and cleanſing all places ſo well, that no foot-ſteps nor any other things might be ſeen out of order. They after that, got over the Wall again into <hi>Ibrahim's</hi> own Garden, and went to reſt the remainder of the night.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sultana</hi> having heard of <hi>Roxana's</hi> Beauty and Wit, ſhe had a great deſire to ſee her, wherefore ſhe ſent the next morning, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite her and her mother to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio.</hi> This being ſuch an honour as was not to be refus'd, they ſoon got <hi>Aladin</hi>'s conſent for their going thither; where they were very courteouſly receiv'd by the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi> who, finding <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Beauty and Wit, beyond all that ſhe had heard, did preſent her with very Rich Jewels, and was very unwilling to part with her ſo ſoon as that night, ſhe was deſiring their ſtay with her for two or three days longer, which they knew not well how to grant, becauſe <hi>Aladin</hi> did expect them

So that they both remain'd in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> four days, at the end of which, the <hi>Janiſaries</hi> having been appeas'd, with the Money which they had receiv'd for their Arrears, and a Months whole pay advance, provided they would lay down their Arms, and retire every one to their quarters, with aſſurance that thoſe perſons whoſe heads they demanded, ſhould

                     <hi>Roxana</hi> was no ſooner return'd, but ſhe made ready to go viſit her Nurſelings, ſhe had taken the Key of that part of the Garden with her, which ſhe uſually kept in her pocket, and that unexpected delay from attending them, having made her think they were all deſtroy'd for want of watering, ſhe haſtned in great diligence with her Maid into the Garden; but how great was her ſurpriſal, when come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within ſight of the bank or border that ſhe had left the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers growing on, ſeeing nothing but the Mold, ſhe preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that they had all been burnt up by the Sun, but coming

                     <hi>Roxana</hi> was to paſs by that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-Houſe returning, ſhe caſt her Eye that way, and perceived the Paper, which gave her the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of ſtepping in, and taking of it up; ſhe opened, and read it, and was no leſs ſurprized at that than ſhe had been at the Flowers removal, which made her to haſten the more to the Houſe to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inform'd of thoſe Myſteries, if ſhe could poſſible; not without great reflection on the whole. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got in, the firſt thing ſhe did was to enquire of her Father whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had employed any body ſince her abſence to work in the Garden? He told her <hi>no, and that he had not ſeen any perſon appear in it beſides the old Gardner, ſince her going to the Sultana's, though he had walk'd in it more than u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually, ſince he had been detain'd at home by the Janiſaries Tumults, and that as far as he could ſee in her Nurcery over the Quick-ſet, he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62018:22"/>had not perceiv'd any body.</hi> She, after this anſwer made as ſtrict an enquiry as ſhe could poſſible of all the Servants and Slaves, one by one; threatning ſome, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fair promiſes to others, if they would diſcover who had been in her Privy-Garden ſince three or four days; but all to no purpoſe, none could inform her; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe reſolv'd to ſet a Watch for ſome nights, to ſurprize any perſon that ſhould come over the Walls, and have them brought to examination. But all was to no effect. In the mean time, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was not wanting in ſending forth his Scout in the night, to learn how things were: <hi>Moretto</hi> was told that <hi>Roxana</hi> was ſenſible that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her abſence, ſome body had got into her Garden, but which way ſhe knew not, but upon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that is could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the old Gardner's knowledge, though he could not be brought
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62018:23"/>to confeſs any thing, ſhe had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her Father to turn him away, who had readily complyed with his Daughters deſires in a buſineſs of that nature; that they were now in want of a Gardner, and if he would offer himſelf, and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert at it, he might eaſily get the place, which was worth looking after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moretto</hi> having had theſe Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, deſired the Fellow to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him the next day for Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which the other having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do, he returned to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, full freighted with all this good News.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who expected his return with the impatiency of a Lover, was glad to ſee him, and more too, when he heard all the ſtory, and that there was not the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt from his Houſe and Garden; but above all, when <hi>Moretto</hi> told him, that with his leave, if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thought he could do him any
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62018:23"/>ſervice in it, he believ'd that he could be taken as Gardiner into <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Father's Houſe, in the place of the old Gardner that had been diſplac'd, upon <hi>Roxana's</hi> Suſpitions. I'll give thee leave, reply'd <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and charge thee moſt ſtrictly alſo, not to loſe ſo good and great an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſerving me, which if thou doſt honeſtly, I ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet thee free, but ſhall alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee to ſome handſome Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwerable to thoſe great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which thou ſhalt render me; but thou muſt firſt get me in all manner of proviſion for a Week, and then go and engage thy ſelf to that Service, from which I expect ſuch great advantages, as it may be contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved betwixt thee and me, but be thou ſure ſtill to engage induſtriouſly <hi>Roxana</hi> as ſhe paſſes by thee in ſome diſcourſe, upon thy particular skill in the raiſing of Flowers, that ſhe may, if poſſible, have a fancy to thy Service, or at leaſt to ſome of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62018:24"/>thy advice; and obſerve exactly all her actions and her words, that thou mayeſt give me a faithful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. Thus was <hi>Moretto</hi> ſent to get in Proviſions after which he went to learn of his Friend, what hopes he had of his getting him into that Family; <hi>It is your fault, if you get not in this very day,</hi> ſaid the Friend, <hi>I have propoſed the matter; it is hearkned unto, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by</hi> Roxana, <hi>who has commanded me to bring you to her Father ſo ſoon as I ſaw you next, therefore come in with me, and I will ſhew you to our Maſter, who is now walking in the Garden.</hi> So ſaid, ſo done; And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladin</hi> did ſo well like of <hi>Moretto</hi>'s perſon, promiſes of performance, and brisk anſwers, that he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſent for <hi>Roxana,</hi> and told her, he had met with a Gardner, who, he fancied to be more skilful than or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62018:24"/>an Eye over her Garden. This did <hi>Moretto</hi> readily offer to do, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending extraordinary skill, in the raiſing of Flowers from ſeeds; ſhe anſwer'd, <hi>that ſhe wanted no body for that work, but that having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to remove ſome Flowers on the ſhady ſide of the Garden, ſeeing that thoſe did ſo well that had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remov'd there ſhe knew not how, ſhe would therefore employ him in ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up the Earth, and fitting it for the Tranſplantation.

They took their meaſures accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and that they might have a correſpondency together without ſuſpicion; they agreed upon this following expedient. <hi>Moretto</hi> could not write, but read very well his Maſter's Writing; <hi>Ibrahim</hi> therefore was to write what he deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This Intreague went on very currant for three or four days, during which, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> did
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62018:25"/>often ſee <hi>Roxana</hi> in her Garden; but one day <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having heard the Signal, and caſting the Stone ſhort, ſo that it fell on this ſide the Quick-ſet Hedge in <hi>Roxana's</hi> Garden, the door of it being ſhut, and not knowing which way to come at it, he at laſt ſought ſo long, that he ſound in a Corner next to the Wall at the foot of the Quickſet, a ſpace which was more thin than the reſt, he went to work about it, having firſt looked about whether the Coaſt was clear, and with his Knife ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made himſelf a paſſage, which he induſtriouſly covered without and within, with the Branches which he had left to that purpoſe, he got into <hi>Roxana's</hi> Garden, took up the Stone, and could not forbear run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning haſtily to the Hole in the Wall, to ſee whether he could ſee or ſpeak with his Maſter; by good Fortune his Maſter was on the Watch, and hearing a noiſe he went to the peep-hole, where he ſaw his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62018:26"/>
                     <hi>Moretto,</hi> who told him of the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his coming, which was to advertiſe him that he ſhould throw the Stones far enough, for fear that at ſome time or other he ſhould be diſcover'd going to fetch them, through the hole he had made in the Quickſet. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had ſo many Queſtions to make to <hi>Moretto,</hi> that it kept him ſo long in the Garden, that he heard a noiſe at the entry of it. It was <hi>Roxana,</hi> who, ſooner than her uſual hour, was come with a deſign to take <hi>Moretto</hi> into her Garden with her, and ſhew him, what ſhe would have him to do; he heard her ſpeak to her Woman, and by the Voice, judged they were drawing nearer to the place where he was. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> did not know what to adviſe him to he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The readi s of the Anſwer, and the boldneſs with which it was given, did incline <hi>Roxana</hi> to believe the Story <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62018:27"/>ſhe thought ſhe had; gave <hi>Moretto</hi> her Inſtructions. And then ſhe went into the Summer-Houſe, where <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who was ſtill upon the watch, did ſee her pull out a Paper, which ſhe read very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; which done, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> heard her ſay, It is ſtrange that I cannot learn who wrote this Paper, and by what means it was convey'd here? it ſpeaks as if it came from one who knew my very thoughts. As if, Madam, the perſon had heard what you had ſpoken the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaid the Maid, when you ask'd me my thoughts on the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom? <hi>Prithee what did I ſay,</hi> reply'd <hi>Roxana?</hi> That you could not fancy ſuch a Man, Madam, <hi>anſwer'd</hi> the Maid, and then, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſhe,</hi> you gave ſuch a Picture of an Hero, as ſcarce could ever be found in any Romance. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, Madam, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of thoſe Verſes aims at that, when he ſays, that even our Great

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62018:29"/>the Maid, I know one that is very expert, and who has told me ſtrange things concerning my ſelf? <hi>Do what thou wilt, reply'd</hi> Roxana, <hi>but take it all upon thy ſelf, I will have no hand in it.</hi> With that <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> went out of the Summer-houſe, ordering <hi>Moretto</hi> to draw the door after him when he had done in the Garden.</p>
                  <p>You may imagine in what rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was at all he had ſeen and heard; he reſolved to make good uſe of it, and to that purpoſe he did caſt a little Stone over, towards the place where <hi>Moretto</hi> was at work; who did gueſs at the meaning of it, and having ſeen whether the Coaſt was clear, he drew near to the peep-hole, where <hi>Ibrahim</hi> told him all that had paſſed; after which, it was agreed that <hi>Moretto</hi> ſhould ask leave to go to a <hi>Caldean</hi> which he had heard of, who us'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him as to Gardening, to know
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62018:29"/>of him when the Stars and the Moon were in the beſt diſpoſition for to tranſplant thoſe Flowers which <hi>Roxana</hi> had commanded him to remove; that that ſhould be an introduction by which, through his Wit and good Management, he ſhould inſinuate to the Maid that ſhe could not employ a more Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man than that <hi>Caldean,</hi> if ſhe ſhould give him the leaſt hint of any deſire ſhe had that way; and if ſo, that then he himſelf would in a diſguiſe paſs for the <hi>Caldean,</hi> and by that means work his own ends to his full content.

                  <p>The Maid ask'd him, whether he was the <hi>Caldean</hi> of whom their Gardner had given ſo great a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter? he anſwer'd that he was the perſon, in a low voice; ſhe bid him ſpeak louder without fear, becauſe there being No body elſe that could hear: no, ſaid he, then I find you have a mind to play upon me, and ſeeing that you will not deal with me, as I deſign'd to deal with you both, added he, I'll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire immediately, and <hi>Roxana</hi> ſhall not have the ſatisfaction which ſhe expected from me. At the word <hi>Roxana,</hi> both the Miſtreſs and the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62018:31"/>Maid ſtarted, and perceiving that he was going to be as good as his word, by moving from the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; <hi>Hold,</hi> ſaid the Maid by <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana's</hi> Command, <hi>and ſince nothing is hid from your great Knowledge, ſpeak boldly to us both!</hi> Do, ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> and if thou goeſt on as thou haſt begun, I will highly gratifie thee. <hi>Then ſay not one word more, reply'd</hi> Ibrahim, <hi>for it were needleſs; I know your Thonghts, and as dark as it is can read them on your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads as eaſily as the Verſes in your Pocket. Ask me no more queſtions, I ſay, continu'd he, no more than I ask you, but hear with attention all that I know of your Thoughts, your Wiſhes, and Deſires. 'Twas by my great Art, my Infallible Art, that the Flowers in your Garden were Tranſplanted; I cauſed thoſe Verſes to be Wrote, which you found in the Summer-Houſe, after you had given your Maid an account of the qualifications that man ſhould have that you could
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62018:32"/>Love. I infus'd into ſuch a Perſon the deſire to ſee you, to like you, and to give you that ſhort decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Love in Verſe: Ask me not why I did this for you, I ſee your longing deſire to do it, not one word. I read alſo that you would be glad to ſee that ſo accompliſh'd a Perſon, and foreſee that you will love him, and that your hearts will agree. I know that your Servant would have addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſelf to another of my Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but he had not given you all this ſatisfaction. I know your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents will thwart his Love to you, and that it is not to be ſlackned by their greateſt ſeverity; and that you will, nay that you muſt, for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens have Decreed it, I ſay, you muſt repay his Love with yours, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually enterchange your hearts, and by firm Promiſe make you both one Perſon, 'till time and Friends work your Parents to give their conſent. I know, laſtly, that you would be glad to ſee the Perſon's Idea or Form,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62018:32"/>which you ſhall do; hear it ſpeak, Court you, as if it were he himſelf, if you dare with only this your Maid, go to the Summer-Houſe this night at Twelve, where I engage nothing ſhall appear, or be heard to affright you. And now I have done; when you would hear more, ſend for me here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or I'll come of my ſelf when I think you may want me: remember this night at Twelve, on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends much of your future happineſs.</hi> He was Retiring, when <hi>Roxana</hi> holding a Purſe in her hand, cry'd <hi>hold, take this.</hi> At which turning his head, <hi>I deſpiſe your gilded droſs,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and move by Nobler Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</hi> So he retir'd.</p>
                  <p>It is ſcarce to be imagin'd, in what ſurprizal and confuſion of thoughts our <hi>Caldean</hi> left his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and her Maid by his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miraculous Skill, they took him for no leſs than a great Prophet; but the only ſcruple which was left in <hi>Roxana's</hi> thoughts was, why
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62018:33"/>he had, by his own Confeſſion, ſo much concern'd himſelf in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of a Perſon ſo abſolute a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to him as ſhe was? to which the Maid made anſwer, <hi>That though he was not pleas'd to diſcover his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, ſhe might conclude, that if ſhe knew not him, it was probable that he not only knew her, but had alſo ſome great Reaſons that led him to act as he did: and pray, Madam, give me further leave,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>to tell you, that I look not upon this Perſon as one of thoſe ordinary men which we employ to tell us our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</hi> Nor I neither, reply'd <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> I rather take him to be ſome Great Maſter in the Mathematicks, who by his great Reading, and profound Learning, joyned to ſome converſation with Chriſtians, who it is ſaid are incomparable in thoſe fore-telling Arts, has attained to this wonderful heighth of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as to read our very thoughts. And in that opinion, I have a great
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62018:33"/>deſire this night to try this prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious experiment which he has ſaid he would ſhew me. <hi>There Madam, I leave you, ſaid the Maid, and muſt acknowledge my weakneſs, my fears and apprehenſions, of I know not what danger, prevail too much upon me, to venture ſo far.</hi> Thy panick fears, reply'd <hi>Roxana,</hi> I have as much to hazard as you, and yet my deſires are ſo great to ſee the ſhape of the Perſon he mention'd, that I will venture on the thing. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I confeſs, that as you are of a greater Rank, you have more to loſe than I, but then give me leave to tell you, that you have alſo more to gain; for if I miſtake not, pardon my boldneſs, Madam, there is another Motive than bare curioſity that leads you on, while I have neither intereſt nor curioſity enough to venture.</hi> You cannot think it ſhould be Love ſhould puſh me on, reply'd <hi>Roxana,</hi> with a Perſon that I never yet did ſee? <hi>But, Madam, there may be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62018:34"/>Inclinations and Deſires to ſee an Object ſo conformable to ones wiſhes, as our great Man has promis'd to ſhew you,</hi> ſaid the Maid. <hi>I muſt confeſs,</hi> reply'd <hi>Roxana, that nothing could pleaſe me more than to ſee ſuch a Perſon as I have repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my ſelf divers times, and which I have never ſeen. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Madam,</hi> ſaid the Maid, <hi>and it would not be very difficult for you to love ſuch a Perſon too. Thou com'ſt near to the point,</hi> reply'd <hi>Roxana; well, to encourage thee to attend me with thy endeavours, I will confeſs to thee that I have had ſome inclination towards that Perſon who writ the Verſes which I found in the Summer-houſe, ever ſince I firſt read them; and that then, and divers times ſince, I have wiſh'd that that Perſon were qualify'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my deſire. Be ſure to keep my Secret, now that I have made thee my Confident. This is to engage you further,</hi> added ſhe, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>If <hi>Roxana</hi> buſied her thoughts one way, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was not more quiet in another. He hugg'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a thouſand times for carrying on his Deſign ſo well, and without the leaſt ſuſpicion; he thank'd his propitious Stars as oft, and wiſh'd that he might but converſe for ſome few moments with his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto,</hi> to take further meaſures to finiſh the ſo well begun Work: He was weighing every particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; his Fears and Hopes were ebbing and flowing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as his thoughts did ſuggeſt him, when <hi>Moretto,</hi> who through his hole in the Quickſet had got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Garden, ſo ſoon as he had ſeen the Coaſt clear, did caſt ſome
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62018:35"/>Stones over into his Maſter's Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to give him notice of his being at the hole. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> whoſe ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous thoughts did not hinder him from being attentive that way, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently repair'd to the place; where, hearing that it was <hi>Moretto,</hi> he caſt the Rope-ladder over the Wall, and bid him come over to him. There he told him what he had done, and in what an amazement he had left both Miſtreſs and Maid; what he had promis'd them to perform that night at Twelve, and what he deſign'd further to act. <hi>But, my dear Moretto,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>doſt thou think that</hi> Roxana <hi>will have ſo much Curioſity and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as to adventure her ſelf at the Place? Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Moretto, if the Character you have given her of your own Perſon has touch'd her Heart, you may be ſure that ſhe will paſs over all dangers to ſee ſo charming an Object; and that ſhe had ſome propenſity that way, is clear,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62018:36"/>by her deſire to be preſent at the</hi> Caldean's <hi>Diſcourſe. However,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Ibrahim, I will prepare my ſelf for that purpoſe, in which I muſt have thy aſſiſtance to carry all off without the leaſt ſuſpicion.</hi> Then he told him how he had laid the Plot, what part he was to act, and that he would perform the reſt; he bid him put on that <hi>Caldean</hi> Habit which he had worn, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe himſelf; that he ſhould hide himſelf behind the Buſhes which ſurrounded the Summer-Houſe, ſo that he might ſee when they were got into the Houſe, that then he ſhould pull the door cloſe by a String ty'd to the Lock, and keep it ſhut on the out-ſide, till he ſhould hear him to diſmiſs them, and then he ſhould let looſe the door, ſlip off the ſtring, and get as faſt as he could into the out-houſes where he uſually lay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having made an end of informing <hi>Moretto</hi> how he ſhould
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62018:36"/>act, he gave him ſome Lamps to ſet up in divers places of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-houſe, with order to watch their coming, and to fling a Stone for Signal of their approach; after which <hi>Moretto</hi> got over the Wall in his <hi>Caldean</hi> Habit, diſpos'd of the Lamps, faſtn'd the String to the Lock of the Door, and went to watch their coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> in the mean time being too full of imaginations to get a moments ſleep, began to talk to her Maid, which was over-heard by <hi>Moretto,</hi> as he was got to the outward Quickſet, which parted <hi>Roxana's</hi> Garden from her Fathers; this made him Curious to lend an ear to thoſe Voices, but what with their ſpeaking too low for fear of being over-heard in the Houſe, and with the diſtance he was at, he could not underſtand what they ſaid, ſo that he did not know who thoſe perſons were; but he was ſoon inform'd of that, for <hi>Roxana</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62018:37"/>a mind to try her own Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as well as her Maids, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into her Father's Garden before hand, (for then it was but half an hour after Eleven) ſhe had ventur'd out, and they were walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Quickſet partition, on the other end of it that <hi>Moretto</hi>'s Creeping hole was ſo that he could diſtinctly hear the Maid ſay, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I know not what I ail, but a certain horrour ſeizes me on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which makes me fancy I ſee ſtrange things about me.</hi> Thou art able, reply'd <hi>Roxana,</hi> to produce fear in the moſt reſolute, with thy ſtrange fancies; and thy talk ſo works upon my imagination, that methinks I ſee ſtrange things alſo; I find we are both very unfit for ſo great an Enterpriſe, continu'd ſhe, and ſeeing thou haſt not the Courage to hearten me up, I'll think of a timely retreat, and deſiſt from this attempt, at leaſt for this night. With this ſhe turn'd back to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

                  <p>

This gave time to <hi>Moretto</hi> to recover himſelf, and to get before them unſeen into the Room, where he found the Door open, not doubting but that they came from thence; where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62018:38"/>to ſtand, and to affright them back again towards the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Roxana</hi> had ſtood liſtning a while, and heard no more noiſe, ſhe began to whiſper to her Maid, <hi>that ſhe wiſh'd her ſelf in the Houſe again.</hi> To which the Maid anſwer'd, that it was her thoughts alſo; and added, pray Madam let us get in ſo ſoon as we can; this ſhe ſaid, creeping ſoftly after her Miſtreſs, that mov'd as ſlow as ſhe could; they got at laſt to the door of the Room, where the Maid, being more frighted than the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, would have run in firſt. But what a horrour was ſhe in, when ſhe found the paſſage poſſeſt by the <hi>Caldean,</hi> which ſhe knew by his Habit, with that ſmall light of the Stars which they had. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently run back, giving a ſhriek, which made <hi>Roxana</hi> do the like; but ſtriking violently one againſt another it broke the violence of it;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62018:38"/>ſo that it being in the deepeſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the night, and far from the body of the Houſe, by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune it was not heard. But what with the fear and the ſhock they had given one another they both had fallen, the Maid in a ſwoon, and <hi>Roxana</hi> not far from it. This put <hi>Moretto</hi> into greater trouble than before, he knew the hour was near, that his Maſter was in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of them, but how to get them thither he knew not; he found that <hi>Roxana</hi> mov'd, which made him to tell her, <hi>That ſhe ſhould not fear any thing ſo long as he was by her; that ſo ſoon as he did foreſee her fears coming upon her, and that ſhe deſign'd to retire, and not give her ſelf the ſatisfaction of ſeeing that which ſhe moſt deſired, and on which depended all her future miſery or happineſs, he had Tranſported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to her aid, to ſtrengthen her confidence, and to be her Protector; That he very much feared ſome evil
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62018:39"/>would befall her Lover or her ſelf for the want of Faith, and that if ſhe would not bring her own or the Perſons ruine upon him, which ſhe was to have ſeen, ſhe ought to go on boldly, being aſſured that under his conduct, ſhe and her Maid would both remain ſecure from all manner of dangers.</hi> All this he ſaid, feigning his voice, pretending to ſpeak ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for fear of being over-heard; but his deſign was to diſguiſe his voice that they ſhould not perceive the change was put upon them. They had never heard him ſpeak but once before, and had not ſeen his face till then, becauſe that at the Window, the Street being lower than the Room <hi>Roxana</hi> was in, they could not well ſee his face, ſo that he paſs'd for currant for the ſame perſon in both their Opinions; I ſay in both their Opinions, becauſe that by this time the Maid was recovered out of her Trance, and had lain ſtill and heard part of what
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62018:39"/>
                     <hi>Moretto</hi> had ſaid to <hi>Roxana,</hi> and was ſitting on the ground at her Miſtreſſes feet, whom <hi>Moretto</hi> had raiſed up. <hi>Roxana</hi> being ſomewhat comforted, aſſured, and affrighted by the danger ſhe or her Lover would be in, if ſhe ſtill perſiſted in refuſing to go, told the <hi>Caldean, that if he would accompany her, ſhe would under his protection adventure on.</hi> He having again ſpoken all he could to encourage them both, with aſſurance of his protection, <hi>Roxana</hi> gave him the Key to open the door of her Garden, and he led them both towards it. He was ſtill in a peck of troubles for want of an opportunity of giving <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> the ſign of their approaches, that the Lamps might be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And <hi>Roxana</hi> had more than once complain'd of the darkneſs, which ſhe confeſs'd increas'd her fears; and to aſſure her, he had told her that he would order lights ſufficiently by that time they got
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62018:40"/>there. <hi>I have but to ſpeak a word, give a ſign to my Spirits, or caſt a ſtone, and they will ſoon obey my will; you ſhall ſee the Experiment of it, continu'd he, ſo ſtooping he took up a ſtone, and flung it towards the Summer-Houſe; now, ſaid he, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how the place will be enlightned to your deſire.</hi> They had not gone two ſteps further, but they began to perceive a Light in the Summer-Houſe, which ſtill encreaſed, as they drew near. <hi>Moretto</hi> did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them as well as he could, with aſſurances of ſafety, to take off all their fears; at laſt coming towards the Summer-Houſe, he rais'd his voice on purpoſe, that his Maſter ſhould not be ſurpriz'd at his coming with them, and ſaid, <hi>Now, Madam, is the time for you to baniſh from you all fears, and to fill your heart with Love, for I have done for you more than I promiſed; I only told you I would bring that Perſon's Idea to your preſence, who
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62018:40"/>wrote the Verſes, but there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which muſt ſtill remain ſecret, which makes me think I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do too much for you, wherefore I have tranſmitted the Perſon himſelf here; he was in his ſleep when I did it, but I ſuppoſe by this awakned, or will ſoon awaken at your coming. Moretto</hi> being now come to the ſteps that went to the Summer-Houſe door, <hi>Aſcend, Madam, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, and then admire what I have done for you.</hi> With that, he led her up, and put her into the houſe, then took the Maid who follow'd her Miſtreſs, and put her in alſo, <hi>and bid them go forward to the Table.</hi> As re-aſſur'd as <hi>Roxana</hi> was, ſhe durſt not contradict her Guide, which gave him time to ſhut the door upon them, and to retire. <hi>Roxana</hi> was wondering at the great and clear light which ſo many Lamps as were placed there did give; when that <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> as if new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awakned, being ſet off with the

Then looking on <hi>Roxana, Ha! What do I ſee? the very Darling of my Soul, my Heart's Delight, and all that I moſt deſired. What good Angel has been ſo kind as to continue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my Dream with ſuch a bleſſed Viſion!</hi> Roxana, <hi>Divine</hi> Roxana <hi>here, and I ſtand ſtill, and not caſt at her feet a Heart that is ſo wholly hers! Pardon, ſweet Angel, the Errour that the great ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal I am in, at ſo fair a Viſion, has caus'd me to commit; and deign to accept the offers of an Heart whoſe greateſt Glory is to be your Slave.</hi> With that he was going to throw himſelf at <hi>Roxana</hi>'s feet, when ſhe moving her Body that

Speak, give me ſome ſigns of Life; a Voice coming from ſo admirable a Shape, cannot but be all Harmony to my Heart.</hi> At this <hi>Roxana</hi> bowing forward, was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak, when he again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted her thus; <hi>By Heavens, it moves! but one word, and I am bleſſed for ever.</hi> Then did <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> ſay, <hi>Whoe're you are, that thus exerciſe your Wit and Fancy upon a Perſon who knows her ſelf much
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62018:42"/>inferiour to what the extaſy you ſeem to be in leads you to ſpeak; know that I am the real</hi> Roxana, <hi>Miſtreſs of this place. If all I hear and ſee is not Inchantments, which I am apt to believe is, when I conſider that Shape which is before me, and thoſe Expreſſions, which, whether true or feigned, real or deluſive, pleaſe my Ears and Heart? and if you are as real Subſtance as I find my ſelf to be, I may now ſay I have ſeen the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe things which I before did only frame in my imagination; and ſince I find that all which that Great man has told me proves true, even beyond my expectation, I am apt to believe that all the reſt he has told me will be of the ſame ſtamp.</hi> If he has ſaid, Madam, reply'd <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that you ſhould ſee a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in whoſe ſingle heart there was more Love contain'd for you, than in all the World beſides, (though all were too little yet.) If that he told you, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62018:42"/>for that perſon to live a day longer after ſeeing you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hopes that you would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of an Heart which is wholly yours. If he has aſſur'd you that from the firſt moment that perſon beheld you, he vow'd to live e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally yours: I am the perſon. In confirmation of which, I here lay my life, and all I can call mine at your feet; proteſting by our great Prophet, that I will never riſe again from this place, till you are pleas'd to accept and receive this free (though unworthy) Gift I make you of my ſelf. Saying this, he ſlung himſelf at <hi>Roxana</hi>'s feet; ſhe extended her hand to raiſe him, but he taking hold of it, and preſſing it hard with his lips, <hi>No, Madam,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>never muſt I riſe from this place, till you have ſpoke my happineſs.</hi> To which thus <hi>Roxana</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>That I may the ſooner relieve you from this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming and uneaſie poſture, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62018:43"/>to follow what the Heavens have decreed, in which peradventure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs ſomething of my own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for I cannot but think, when I reflect on all that has been acted this night, that it is the will of Heaven. Here is my Hand that I receive thoſe offers you have made me of your Heart, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of which, I give you another, that was never any others but mine, and now yours. And I, Madam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Ibrahim, do take the boldneſs to ſeal this Contract on this white Author of my Happineſs with my Lips.</hi> With this ſhe took him up; then ſaid to him, looking on her Maid, <hi>Here is one ſhall be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Witneſs of our ſecret Love, till we find means to get our Friends conſents; mean time, you know my Father's ſeverity towards me, by which you may gueſs that if he had been now at</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>I ſhould not have had this opportunity, which I know not when we ſhall have again,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62018:43"/>becauſe he is expected here again to morrow.</hi> After this they fell to particular diſcourſes about the means they ſhould uſe to ſee one another; and they agreed that <hi>Moretto,</hi> for having been ſo inſtrumental to their mutual happineſs, in bringing them to the knowledge of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean,</hi> ſhould be admitted into the Confidence, not doubting but that betwixt him and her Maid they ſhould have ſuch frequent news of one another, that they ſhould not be long before they met again; upon which, and divers other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of that nature, day begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to break forth, they thought fit to ſeparate, which, after a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand repeated aſſurances of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy on both ſides, they did; he leading firſt <hi>Roxana</hi> to the Gate of her Garden, then he getting over the Wall by his Rope-ladder.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62018:44"/>Cloudy Day. Our Lovers Joys, like all vehement Motions, were too great to laſt long, and though the Cauſe of it was not in themſelves, but from abroad; yet ſo ſuddain, ſo great, and ſo paſſionate a Love, as was between them, rendred them not long happy, as you ſhall hear from what follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was a Perſon, that in all reſpects was very deſirable; no wonder then if that <hi>Roxana</hi> was ſo impatient to ſee again a Perſon ſo like that which ſhe had fram'd in her imagination, that could only pleaſe her. She had employ'd her Maid, and the Maid <hi>Moretto,</hi> ſo that ſhe was certain that her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would not return the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to <hi>Conſtantinople. Ibrahim</hi> was to be advertis'd of that, and means contriv'd of getting to the Summer-Houſe, the only convenient place for their private interview; <hi>Moretto</hi> was to be conſulted upon this, wherefore, when <hi>Roxana</hi> knew
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62018:44"/>that he was at work, ſhe took the opportunity to ſpeak to him, as ſhe went to viſit her Flowers towards the Evening, and told him, <hi>That ſhe did not know how</hi> Ibrahim <hi>could get into the Summer-houſe that night; as he had been the night before? Why, Madam, the ſame way, reply'd</hi> Moretto. <hi>We have no longer any need of the</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean's <hi>aſſiſtance,</hi> ſaid <hi>Roxana, and I would gladly converſe with him, after his own coming to this place. Moretto,</hi> finding that he had like to have committed an error, ſaid, <hi>Madam, though he was laſt night carried into the Summer Houſe, while he was aſleep, by the</hi> Caldean's <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Power and Art, yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he convey'd him there through the Air over thoſe Walls which encompaſs your Garden; and no queſtion, Madam, but that if I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, by your Order, of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, let me but know the hour, and his Love will be ſufficient to find him Wings to flye to you, if all other
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62018:45"/>means were failing, he'll find or make a way over the Walls, no queſtion. Well, ſaid</hi> Roxana, <hi>I leave that care to you, fail not to give him timely notice of it; but,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>where will you find him? we forgot that. Trouble not your ſelf, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Moretto, the</hi> Caldean <hi>will ſoon ſatisfie me in that. 'Tis true,</hi> reply'd <hi>Roxana, but after you have got that knowledge haſten to him, and deliver him this Note:</hi> Then ſhe gave him the Note, and went to walk in her Garden as ſhe us'd to do; but being come near the Summer-houſe, ſhe had not the power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance one ſtep forward till ſhe had gone into it; where being ſeated, ſhe began to reflect on all that had happen'd to her there the laſt night: a while after, ſhe pull'd <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Verſes out of her boſom, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kiſs'd them, ſhe read them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, kiſs'd them, and put them into her boſom again; then fell a raving as before; and then by and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62018:45"/>by again, out would ſhe pull the Paper, kiſs, read, and kiſs it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and this ſport ſhe repeated over divers times. All this while <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> through his peep-hole, had the pleaſure of ſeeing how much his beloved Miſtreſs did make of his Verſes; for he had ſeen them ſo often that he could diſcern them at ſuch a diſtance. This ſight did infinitely pleaſe him, and he was ſo attentive at it, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd not <hi>Moretto,</hi> who was coming to him, 'till he was cloſe by, he acquainted him with <hi>Roxana</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, then gave him the Letter, which being opened by <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> he read in it what follows.</p>

                        <p>You'll wonder it may be at my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, in making theſe advances, which I ſhould, with the Decorum of my Sex, have expected firſt from you, but mighty Love cauſing me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on all that the Heavens have done for me of late, I can no longer withſtand his invincible Power, it is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62018:46"/>he that has guided my Pen, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you that my Father not return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home this day, this night may be as freely ours as was the laſt. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven knows what we ſhall do to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue our enterview after <hi>Aladin</hi>'s return; but I leave all to Love, to whom I have wholly devoted my ſelf. I will not doubt but that you will be as deſirous to meet me in the Summer-houſe this night, at the ſame hour, as I ſhall be to ſee you there. It is <hi>Roxana</hi> gives you this advice.</p>

                  <p>It was now <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s turn to kiſs the Letter, which he did over and over, and having bid <hi>Moretto</hi> to fetch him Ink and Paper, he paſs'd his time till his return, in contemplating his Dear <hi>Roxana,</hi> who by this time was fallen aſleep, holding the Verſes in her hand, which were ready to drop. To enjoy the better the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the cool Air, ſhe had caſt aſide her Vail more than uſually, by which he did diſcover whole
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62018:46"/>mines of Beauties which were ſpread all over her neck and Breaſts. When <hi>Moretto</hi> was return'd, he could not take off his Eyes, from ſo Charming an Object, and when he did it, he enviouſly turned his back towards the Hole, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto</hi> ſhould not rob him with his Eyes, of ſome part of that which he thought was wholly due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Love.</p>
                  <p>In this place, as in many others of this Book, I might make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers curious Reflections; as here, for example, jealouſie is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural effect of Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But my deſign being to give you only a bare account of the Court-Secret, according to the faithfulneſs of my Memoires; beſides that, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Novel is ſufficient enough of it ſelf to furniſh me with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall decline all ſuch kind of ſuperfluous digreſſions, and ſtick cloſe to my Subject.

                  <p>This Letter being finiſhed, he diſpatched <hi>Moretto</hi> away with more than uſual haſte, only that he might loſe no more of that ſight which his ſleeping <hi>Roxana</hi> did afford him. He was ſtill gazing on, wiſhing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62018:47"/>himſelf all turn'd into Eyes, that he might devour her with looking on, when on a ſudden a great noiſe was heard, of a confuſion of Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which ſtill drawing nearer to his Garden, he thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into his Houſe, for fear of a ſurprize. When he was got thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he more diſtinctly heard the Voices, and gathered by them, that it was a Slave who had made his eſcape. Some of the Purſuers were for getting over the Wall, and to ſearch in the Garden; others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſaid that no body liv'd in that houſe; the ſooner for that, cryed others, let us ſearch there; at laſt the moſt voices carried it, for the ſearch in the Garden: Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently got over by the help of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, at which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having made faſt all his doors, he kept within, and let them do what they pleaſed without, when, after they had looked all over, and found no body, they left off, but it was not without ſome cunning obſervations,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62018:48"/>made by one of thoſe that came firſt over; he, before the reſt was come, had obſerved ſome footſteps new made upon the Graſs which was high, and thoſe ſteps tending towards the Houſe, he had follow'd them, and leaning his Ear to the Key-hole of the door, he had heard ſome kind of treading in the Houſe, all this gave him ſome Jealouſie, that the Fugitive was gotten into it; he made no more noiſe of it at that time, but was reſolved to watch thereabouts that night, to ſeize on the Fugitive himſelf, when he ſhould think of getting off, and have the ſole Honour and Reward of the buſineſs to himſelf; with theſe thoughts he mixt himſelf with the reſt of the Rabble, and got over the Wall as he had got in, and the noiſe going by little and little, further and further, at laſt all was quiet as before.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the Storm was over, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> could no longer refrain from going again to have another

                  <p>Mean time, <hi>Roxana</hi> on her part did not think the time leſs long, though ſhe had ſlept ſome part of it away. She had receiv'd <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s anſwer by <hi>Moretto,</hi> and ſhe was ſo ordering of things, and diſpoſing of the Servants, that none but her own Maid and <hi>Moretto,</hi> the two Confidents, ſhould know of the buſineſs: All things being put in order, and the hour drawing near,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62018:49"/>ſhe thought it would be ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to her, to ſpend the reſt of the time at the Summer Houſe, which ſhe did, taking her Maid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with her, and leaving <hi>Moret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> at her Garden door, to be in readineſs to give them the Alarm, if any Enemy ſhould appear.</p>
                  <p>At laſt the twelve a Clock at night Prayers were proclaim'd from the top of a Tower, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtom of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where they have no publick Clocks, nor Bells; and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> came to the Garden with his Rope-Ladder, he preſently fix'd it, and got up, and was ſtriding over the wall, when a piece was diſcharg'd, which ſhot him quite through the Body, ſo that he fell head-long into <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Garden. He that had ſhot him, followed cloſe his Game, not knowing which way he had fallen, and believing that he had ſhot him, and not finding him on that ſide of the wall, cryed out, if there be any body in the next Garden, ſtop
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62018:49"/>that Fugitive which I have ſhot; and looking for ſome convenient place to get over, he at laſt found the Rope-Ladder, on which having got, he leapt into <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and was ſtill ſo attentive after his purſute, that he conſider'd not the perſons that were by, but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in his Proweſs, <hi>'twas I kill'd him,</hi> ſaid he: <hi>Moretto,</hi> who was come, and had ſeen what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to his poor Maſter, was in ſuch a rage at this Villains Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that with a Spade he had in his hand, he cleav'd the fellow's head in two, and laid him ſpraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the ground.</p>
                  <p>You may imagine in what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>Roxana</hi> was, who, ſo ſoon as ſhe had heard the Gun go off, and the perſon fall, imagining it could be none other than her <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> ſhe had run to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtunn'd by his fall, ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded him dead, conſidering the great effuſion of Blood which came from him; ſhe preſently ſent her
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62018:50"/>Maid to call the Servants of the houſe up, and to ſend them for help; ſhe tore her Hair, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſtop his wounds with the Linnen which ſhe rent off her ſelf; ſhe rais'd his head in her lap, call'd upon him to ſpeak to her, and finding no anſwer come from him, and that he was without motion, ſhe fell backwards with her head againſt the Wall, in a ſwoon. In this condition were they both found by the Servants, the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which had been ſent for, and by her own Mother, who had been told of the ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, by ſome over-diligent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that had brought her thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The Surgeons, moving of his body to ſearch his wounds, ſaw a great deal of Blood on <hi>Roxana,</hi> which had run from him, and they not knowing of the buſineſs any more than they ſaw, did judge her hurt alſo, and by the place where the blood was, that ſhe was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62018:50"/>wounded. They ſtirring of <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s body, he came to life again, open'd his Eyes, turn'd his head about, and preſently ask'd where <hi>Roxana</hi> was, and whether ſhe was ſafe? He was anſwer'd, that there ſhe lay by him dead, as they ſuppos'd; <hi>Then is all your aſſiſtance in vain,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I cannot live, if ſhe be not, open my wounds afreſh, or I'le tear them open with my own hands,</hi> continu'd he. <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this was run to her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with rubbing of her, and giving her ſome Cordials, ſhe was brought to her ſelf again. The firſt thing ſhe did, as if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted together, was to turn her head about, and then to ask where <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was? <hi>Here, Madam,</hi> ſaid, one. <hi>Ay and dead,</hi> ſaid ſhe! <hi>then farewel life, I can no longer live, if he is dead.</hi> With that ſhe flung her ſelf back, and was returning into a ſwoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit, but that divers cry'd out aloud, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> is not dead, he lives.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62018:51"/>
                     <hi>Yes, Madam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ibrahim, long enough to tell you that I dye yours, as I deſign'd ever to have liv'd. Then do I breathe again,</hi> ſaid <hi>Roxana.</hi> At laſt the wound being ſearch'd, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons were ask'd what judgment they gave of it, whether Mortal or not? They with down looks, and ſorrowful countenances, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, there was no hope of life. At which words, <hi>Roxana</hi> crying out aloud, <hi>then farewel</hi> Ibrahim, <hi>I'le go before:</hi> ſhe fell into a greater ſwoon than before, in which ſhe was carryed by Servants unto her Apartment, and laid in her bed. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was alſo carryed to the houſe of one of his Friends, that he might have better Attendance, where after he had languiſh'd two days, he dyed, crying continually on <hi>Roxana,</hi> his dear <hi>Roxana;</hi> and <hi>Moretto</hi> was ſtruck with ſo much ſorrow at the loſs of ſo good a Maſter, that he ſtabb'd himſelf, and dyed at his Maſter's beds feet.</p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:62018:51"/>
                  <p>As for <hi>Roxana,</hi> ſhe continu'd ſo long in her fainting, that every body near her thought her to be dead; and when ſhe came to her ſelf again, it was with ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies, ſuch unjointed diſcourſes, and ſuch ſudden flyings out, that it was eaſie to perceive her grief was greater than ſhe could bear. Her Maid was had into examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who having confeſs'd all, was at laſt diſmiſt, and put away from her Miſtreſs's ſervice; they would have confronted her with <hi>Moretto</hi> and the <hi>Caldean,</hi> but the firſt being dead, by which means the laſt was not to be found, the buſineſs termin'd there. The body of that Wretch who had committed the Murder was found to be the Perſon who had watch'd for the Fugitive; he was deliver'd to his Friends, who came to demand him: Another perſon was plac'd near <hi>Roxana,</hi> on the account ſhe might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Comforts to her as well
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62018:52"/>as other Services during her diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſhe was Siſter to a Mufti, whoſe name was <hi>Repſet,</hi> and hers was <hi>Zora:</hi> This Mufti did alſo frequently viſit <hi>Roxana</hi> during her ſorrow, in order to reduce her to her ſelf again. But enough of that at preſent; we ſhall have occaſion more than once to ſpeak of this Mufti and his Siſter, till then I leave giving you a Character of them: mean time, leaving <hi>Roxana</hi> to the care of thoſe perſons that were appointed by her Father and Mother to attend her, we will now come to the continuance of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical part of this Novel, till we have occaſion to return to <hi>Roxana,</hi> and bring her again in play.</p>

                  <p>His death ſurpriz'd all the world, but thoſe that were of the Cabal, and made way for his undoubted Succeſſour <hi>Amurat</hi> to mount on the Throne.

                  <p>Of Truth, <hi>Amurat</hi> of himſelf had very good inclinations, he was very Juſt, Pious, Religious, Charitable, and deſirous to oblige
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62018:53"/>all perſons, that came near him, and had he been left to his own Will and Pleaſure, he had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Govern'd the Empire with all Peaceableneſs, Tranquility and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to the great joy and content of his people. But what will not a blind Zeal do, which is continually fomented by ſuch as breathe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ruine and deſtruction! It was now high time for <hi>Cha-Abbas</hi> and all his Creatures, to put the laſt hand to the great work; to this purpoſe, all the Prieſts of <hi>Haly</hi>'s Sect, which were about the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, were charg'd never to let him reſt, till they had brought him to a firm reſolution, of changing the Religion of the Empire, by to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally rooting out and expelling from it, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Religion, and eſtabliſhing in <hi>lieu</hi> of it, the Sect of <hi>Haly:</hi> This peal was daily rung in <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Ears, proclaiming that the Heavens having made choice of him, to be the great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62018:54"/>inſtrument of ſo good, ſo great, and ſo pious a work, by which he ſhould avoid all expurgatory pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for his ſins, and ſhould be immediately carried up by Angels, and laid at the feet of the great <hi>Ala,</hi> who ſhould ſeat him in a Throne of Glory near unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; that he would leave behind him here on Earth a Name and Fame that ſhould endure for ever, that his Memory would ever be in good Odour to all good perſons, and that he ſhould be here wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as a Saint, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like aſſurances of honour and Glory, did at laſt prevail with him.</p>
                  <p>This was the daily practice of the Mahometiſts, but they finding that though through their inceſſant plying of <hi>Amurat,</hi> all the day long, they brought him to their Bow, yet every morning, he would, after conſulting with his Pillow, ſtill continue in the goodneſs of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62018:54"/>his natural diſpoſition, ſo that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies appeared cold in the morning in the promoting of their deſigns, how warm ſoever they had left him the night before. They had recourſe to another Stratagem, the ſame promiſes of greatneſs and glory in this world, and the next, which they had promiſed to him, they alſo aſſur'd to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> that ſhe ſhould enjoy in ample manner, if ſhe did but plye <hi>Amurat</hi> at night, when they were in bed together, as they did all the day long, telling her on the other hand, that if ſhe was ſlack or remiſs in it, ſhe would not only loſe all thoſe Honours, that Happineſs and bliſs which was prepared for her, but incur by her neglect eternal Miſery.</p>
                  <p>To what height will not a blind Zeal be ſcrew'd up, by ſuch fair promiſes on the one hand, and the terror of ſuch dreadful puniſhments on the other! No wonder then, if that the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s good, mild, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62018:55"/>affable diſpoſition, which ſhe had alwaies ſhewn before ſhe was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, did change into a moroſe temper, and into a moſt violent averſion againſt all thoſe that were not of <hi>Haly</hi>'s Sect: She aſſur'd <hi>Haly</hi>'s Prieſts, that ſhe ſhould not loſe all thoſe glories, which had been promiſed her, by any neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in the performance of what was required of her: Of truth, ſhe ſo ply'd <hi>Amurat</hi> by night, and the <hi>Haliſts</hi> by day, that the worſt of his Subjects or Slaves, was happy in compariſon to him; at bed, at Table, at Council, at his Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Divertions, nay even at his Devotion, and greateſt Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he was ſo perpetually haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and bated by thoſe Wolves in Sheeps cloathings, that he divers times wiſh'd himſelf in the ſame Station that he had formerly been, provided he might but enjoy alſo that tranquility of Mind and Spirit which he then poſſeſs'd. Who
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62018:55"/>could reſiſt, to ſo many redoubled, nay rather to ſuch a continu'd aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault? For his own eaſe and quiet, and that he might but enjoy that content and quiet, which the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of his Servants poſſoſs'd, he was forc'd to yield to the <hi>Haliſt</hi>'s perpetual ſolicitations, he promis'd to do all that they would, and to root out of his Dominions the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan Religion, to eſtabliſh in lieu of it, therein, the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> to change and alter the Laws which had been from time to time made againſt that Sect, and to make new Laws, or that he would dye in the attempt.</p>
                  <p>From the moment that the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt</hi>'s had got that aſſurance from him, they gave him liberty to breathe again. Preſently was <hi>Cha-Abbas</hi> acquainted with the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the <hi>Haliſts,</hi> and great joy was expreſſed at it through all <hi>Perſia.</hi> But th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> was not all, there was ſtill more to be done; they had
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62018:56"/>got but one point yet, the preſent eſtabliſhment of <hi>Haly</hi>'s Sect, but how that ſhould be ſecur'd for the future, was now the buſineſs in hand. New Orders were therefore ſent from <hi>Perſia,</hi> that the Prieſts of <hi>Haly</hi> ſhould immediately enter upon that work, that a Succeſſour of the ſame Sect ſhould be procur'd, and ſecur'd, to ſupply <hi>Amurat</hi>'s place after his Death, for fear of a relaps of the whole Empire, into the Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> again; and preſently the whole Crew fell to work: Divers ways were propos'd, too long here to be repeated, my Memoires mention only two of the moſt eminent, which were moſt inſiſted upon. The firſt was, that the Bodies of <hi>Amurat</hi> and of his <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi> ſhould be ſo prepar'd and order'd by Medicines, as that the <hi>Sultana</hi> might bring forth a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous young Prince, to live, to be brought up in the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> and to be Succeſſor to <hi>Amurat.</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:62018:56"/>All thoſe means were us'd, but to no purpoſe; this ſtubborn refuſal of Nature, not to comply with the deſires of ſuch perſons, as uſe to overcome all obſtacles, in lieu of teaching them that <hi>Ala</hi> was above all their deſigns, did but enrage them the more, and make them the more earneſtly bent upon their wicked enterpriſes. A Succeſſour was to be produc'd, that ſhould be of the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> and that ſhould ſtep in betwixt the Heir apparent to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire and it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the right Heir was of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unfit for their purpoſes, wherefore no means were to be left unſought after, no ways untry'd, and no deſigns unattempted, that could conduce to the work in hand.</p>
                  <p>They therefore concluded to try what Prayers, Pilgrimages, and Offerings would do. The thing was propos'd to the Emperor and the <hi>Sultana,</hi> and in ſhort agreed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62018:57"/>upon, and the day prefix'd for the ſetting forth of the Court, that all things might be in a readineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the appointed time, yet ſtill delay'd from time to time by the <hi>Sultana</hi> and the Emperor's orders.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the Prieſts of <hi>Haly</hi> was reckon'd in the firſt rank this <hi>Repſet,</hi> which I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, to be employ'd in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of Conſolations to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>Roxana.</hi> Not that he was more Learned, or endowed with greater Gifts, or of a more Pious, Religious, and Sober Life than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but that through his Crafty Inſinuations, and Indefatigable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and Attendance, he had got firſt the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by her means and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, had rendred himſelf Maſter of his Maſter, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: He had his Ear as well as his Heart, ſo that he did order and diſpoſe of all places of Authority and Truſt: He was of all the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62018:57"/>Councils, even to the moſt ſecret and particular: In a word, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Dominus fac totum.</hi> This acquired him a great Repute, Eſteem, Reſpect, and even Fear; for thoſe that had no occaſion of his Services, did fear his Frowns, on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended their Ruine, as their Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment on his Smiles and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentions.</p>
                  <p>This Creature, of mean, obſcure Extraction, of as mean a mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul, and of vitiated Principles, in the Station he was got, was the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> or great Wheel, which ſet the whole Machine of the <hi>Haliſts</hi> to work in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; he had acceſs to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and to the <hi>Sultana</hi> at all times, at all hours of the day and night, even when they were in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateſt retirements: He had ſince his greatneſs at Court ſhaken off the Rags of Monaſteries, and had lick'd himſelf from a ſhapeleſs Cub, into a ſpruce Courtier. The Court
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62018:58"/>was then repleniſh'd with Ladies, whoſe Beauties might compare with thoſe of all the other Courts in the World. But the <hi>Sultana</hi> did tarniſh them all, and forc'd them tacitely to confeſs, that ſhe alone eclipſed their Luſtre. The <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> had her Diverſions amongſt thoſe Ladies which compos'd her Court; and their Beauties did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract to them from all parts of the Empire divers Adorers of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sex. But ſtill our Mufti not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his multiplicity of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs elſewhere, would make one; he was always amongſt the Ladies, and it was thought that thoſe hours which he was to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Private and Publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and in other Devotions, he ſpent in his converſation with the Female Sex; being led thereunto by that moſt powerful <hi>Magnet,</hi> his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination: He had not been ſatisfied with thoſe private Stealths which he made on particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62018:58"/>Wives and Daughters, under the Authority and Power of his Function; but his Ambition and Luſt ſtill encreaſing, as did his Fortune and Credit, he reſolved to look higher, and to attempt the higheſt piece of Villany, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, under the Cloak of his Religion, and the deſign of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of it, as could be imagined.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sultana,</hi> according to divers occurrences, had given our Mufti not only a free acceſs into her greateſt retirements, but in diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had been more free with him in her Speeches and in Carriage than with others; her Beauty and this Freedom, which he thought his good Meen and Deſerts had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him, did ſo puff up his mind, that he thought it no difficult thing to ingratiate himſelf into the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>'s Affections: this impudent conceit of his (I can term it no better) did ſet all his Wits to work to accompliſh his end; to which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62018:59"/>purpoſe, he did watch but for an opportunity of privately deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Sultana</hi> what he had to ſay without interruption.</p>
                  <p>He was not long without one; the <hi>Sultana</hi> being one day ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what indiſpos'd, was retired into her Cloſet, with order that ſhe would not be diſturbed by any body. Our Mufti, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways on the watch himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Spies he employed, had ſoon an intelligence of it; he dreſs'd himſelf with all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage imaginable, ſet himſelf up in the Glaſs, perfum'd himſelf, in fine, he was fitted as a Bridegroom on his Wedding day; in this equipage he preſents himſelf to the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Cloſet door, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deny'd entrance, he took it in ſuch ſcorn and contempt, that he ſtay'd not a ſecond repulſe, but turning the Lock, entred of his own accord, and boldly intrudes upon the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62018:59"/>over of ſome Papers; he comes up to her briskly, and making a profound reverence, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>your Servant would have deny'd me entrance to you.</hi> The <hi>Sultana,</hi> who was amaz'd to ſee him ſo gay, ſo brisk, and ſo much more confident than uſually, though he never wanted any, looking upon him, as ſomewhat ſurpriz'd, told him, <hi>That the Servant had done nothing but what he had in charge, for that ſhe being indiſpos'd, ſhe had re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>r'd with a deſign nor to be diſturb'd, but ſince that he was come, ſhe bid him to tell her what he had to ſay. Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I have thus intruded on your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy; and the buſineſs I come about requires a long diſcourſe, with a great deal of attention: I think it will be beſt for me to defer the opening of it to another time, and at preſent to retire. If the buſineſs is not of ſuch a nature as to lend fewel to a certain Melancholy which has ſeiz'd
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62018:60"/>me at preſent; I ſhould rather chuſe this time than any other, to hear what you have to ſay,</hi> reply'd the Sultana: <hi>It may afford me ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; and as things are order'd on other accounts, you may not be diſturb'd in the relation: Place your ſelf at eaſe, and let me hear what you would ſay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This good beginning did ſtill inſpire our Mufti more and more with Hope and Joy, which was ſo great that it diſcover'd it ſelf upon his Face, in his Eyes, and in all his Actions; having fitted himſelf for to deliver his Speech, he thus began;</p>
                  <p>It cannot be unknown to you, Madam, how inſtrumental I have been, through the aſſiſtance of Heaven, in bringing about the great work of extirpating of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie out of this Empire, and of ſettling in it the Religion of our Great Prophet <hi>Hali:</hi> Since that it has reach'd the great <hi>Mufti</hi>'s Ears,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62018:60"/>who upon that information, has Commiſſionated me to go on with that work ſo well begun, and to finiſh it, according as I ſhall find occaſions to act. You alſo know, Madam, with how little ſucceſs all Phyſical means have been uſed, both as to your perſon and to the Emperor's; ſo that all helps are laid aſide of having a young Succeſſor from his Loyns. I am not of your Opinion, <hi>replyed the Sultana,</hi> and I believe that the defect lyes more in me than in the Emperor, for though I ſeem not to ſee, that I might not in the leaſt check his pleaſures, I know very well, that of late he has had a Child by one of his Miſtreſſes. Madam, <hi>replyed our</hi> Mufti, you know not the Wiles and Artifices of thoſe kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they value not who gets their Children, they adopt them to what Father they think are moſt proper to own them, it is ſufficient only that they have once
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62018:61"/>enjoyed the man; to perſwade him, nay convince him, that he is the true and right Father of the Child they go with; they go yet further, Madam, according to the perſons inclinations, to one Sex more than another, the Child ſhall be right or wrong of that very Sex; or there ſhall be no child in the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of that Sex, to make a change with. I cannot think however, but that I am more in the fault than <hi>Amurat, replyed the Sultana,</hi> I am apt to believe that a certain decay which I feel in me, is the cauſe of my having no Children of late, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am deſirous to try, what the Heavens will do, being ſolicited to that purpoſe, by thoſe Holy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Pilgrimages, and Offerings, which you your ſelf have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that have been reſolved upon both by the Emperor and the whole Court, and it is no little wonder to me to find you ſo ſoon, in ſo contrary a mind. <hi>Madam</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:62018:61"/>replyed the Mufti, <hi>I muſt deal plainly with you, I have not, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, all the faith that might be imagin'd in thoſe things; of truth, they are good and neceſſary, pious frauds, to amuſe the Vulgar withal, and to work divers good and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ends; and it is to that purpoſe only, that we have now deſigned them, to pleaſe and blind the people, and to exalt our Religion, with which none can compare for contriving of Miracles, of which that of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with Child preſently upon the return from the Pilgrimage, however otherways the Child were got, would be none of the leaſt, but to the purpoſe. Madam, give me leave to tell you, Therefore that what I now propoſe, is not in the leaſt to put off the Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, on the contrary, it is to the ſame end. I have read ſomething of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, have ſeen ſome operations, and diſſections, and I am ſufficiently verſed in thoſe Arts, to be bold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to lay a Wager, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62018:62"/>is not in the leaſt in you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. How can we be ſure of that,</hi> replyed the Sultana? <hi>How, Madam?</hi> anſwered he again, <hi>if you made uſe of any other perſon than the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to trye the Experiment, and that I had layed a great ſum on it, I ſhould ſoon draw the Stakes. You ſpeak of things that cannot be,</hi> replyed the Sultana. <hi>That cannot be, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> replyed the Mufti, <hi>ſay rather, Madam, that you will not admit to be? Is it not my Duty not to admit of any ſuch thing?</hi> ſaid ſhe haſtily, raiſing her voice. <hi>Yes, Madam,</hi> ſaid the Mufti, <hi>according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rules; but, Madam, when the welfare of Empires, the extirpating of Hereſies, the eſtabliſhing of true Religion call for our Aſſiſtances, all thoſe little particular Rules ceaſe, they are overrul'd by an higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and in the very deſign and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eſtabliſhing of Religion, all theſe ſmall tyes upon our Duties, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh into Air; nothing can be too good,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62018:62"/>too great, nor too holy, not to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to ſo laudable and ſo pious a work. That great and general Duty, ſwallows up, and diſpences with all thoſe little ones, which at other times are in force; all muſt yield to that great work: and that which at any other time would appear unjuſt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, becomes the moſt juſt, lawful, and neceſſary good that can be done, when it is for the good of the Church. This Doctrine is ſo new to me,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Sultana, that I am more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at, than edified by it. This, Madam, I have foreſeen,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, and it is for that reaſon, that I did chuſe this opportunity, in which, without diſturbance, I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe thoſe weighty Reaſons, which I have in order to perſwade you, to condeſcend to ſo juſt a requeſt as I am going to make to you. You have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me, I ſay once again, and the nature of the buſineſs requires ſome ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſiderations. Not that I in the leaſt incline to what you propoſe, but that I
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62018:63"/>may arm my ſelf with ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, againſt thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>w Doctrines which you ſet up, that I may have ſome colour for my refuſal, beſides, the natural abhorrence which I find in me towards what you propoſe, and I wiſh that ſome other means might be found out, in which I might be ſo happy as to ſerve the Church. None greater than this, Madam,</hi> Replyed the <hi>Mufti, who would not ſo eaſily be put by, and give me leave to add, Madam, to what I have ſaid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that the Emperor is obliged for the forwarding of ſo great a work, to give his conſent to it, only all the buſineſs in this caſe is, that it muſt be made a Myſtery, a Court-Secret, to avoid all Scandal; for in ſuch Caſes, Sin (if it may be call'd ſo, conſidering to what a pious end it is acted) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes none, and the Scandal only which might ariſe from the Knowledge, and the divulging of ſo great a Secret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſin. In a word, Madam, do but chuſe a Perſon ſecret, diſcreet, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62018:63"/>in all other reſpects according to your liking, and the Bleſſing of Heavens go along with the work.</hi> In ſaying theſe words, the <hi>Mufti</hi> pricked up himſelf, that the <hi>Sultana</hi> ſhould take more notice of his perſon, and perceiving that ſhe made no anſwer, <hi>Let me further tell you, Madam,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, <hi>that this is not the firſt time, ſuch things have been acted, ſtill to a good end, though never none to ſo great and pious an end as this. It was but in the laſt Age, that a Neighbouring Empire to this, had fallen into the hands of its Enemies, had not a</hi> Mufti <hi>been employed to get an Heir unto it; of truth, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, there are no fitter perſons in the World than thoſe of the Clergy, for ſuch works, in divers reſpects; and eſpecially, I would adviſe you, Madam, to employ in this, one whoſe fidelity, truſt, and fore-knowledge and pre-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements in this our great work, is throughly known to you, that you may eaſily gain to you, without making any
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62018:64"/>more perſons privy to thoſe Myſteries, and great Arcanas of States; for in theſe Caſes, it is moſt certain, that the fewer are employed, the more ſecure the buſineſs is from diſcovery.</hi> Here the <hi>Mufti</hi> made a full ſtop, not daring to diſcover his intention more plainly, (though he had ſaid enough already) till he heard how the <hi>Sultana</hi> did reſent it; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that inſtead of giving him ſome anſwer, ſhe buſied her ſelf in peruſing of the papers that were before her. This ſlight did ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, that, he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſaying, <hi>I am ſorry Madam, that I, who have already done ſo much for your ſervice, and that of the Church, and who is ready to lay down his life for the ſervice of ſo great, and ſo char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a Princeſs as you are, ſhould be ſo little regarded, and his good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes ſo little valued.</hi> And with that he put himſelf in a poſture of going, at which the <hi>Sultana,</hi> not ſo much as looking once on him, ſaid,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62018:64"/>
                     <hi>I have already told you, that I would take time to weigh your Reaſons, and the nature of the thing you propoſe to me, and then after that I would give you my anſwer, till then forbear gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your ſelf or me any further trouble about it, I have a mind to ſleep, ſo good night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though our <hi>Mufti</hi> had a months mind to have ſtay'd longer, and to have ventured a little further, in pointing at the moſt proper perſon for the work, which he fancyed to be himſelf, this unexpected an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from the <hi>Sultana</hi> with her haſty riſing up, did force him to a decent retreat, which he did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anſwering one word more, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had made a profound Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mufti</hi> being gone, the <hi>Sultana</hi> reſeated her ſelf, and doubtleſs made many and great reflections on things propos'd to her, by a Mufti too, which were ſo oppoſite to her Principles and Inclinations; after
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62018:65"/>which, having call'd for attendance, ſhe charg'd very ſtrictly all that were about her, and whoſe duties were to keep the doors, not to permit the Mufti <hi>Repſet,</hi> on any pretence whatſoever, to enter, when they knew that ſhe was retired, and alone; ſhe was reſolv'd to give him no more the opportunities of uttering ſuch diſcourſes, ſo unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming his Function to ſpeak, and her Modeſty and Greatneſs to hear; and ſhe knew well enough how to avoid his impertinencies, ſhould he attempt any before Company; and of truth, ſhe was ſo offended at his late diſcourſe, that had it not been that he was a neceſſary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in forwarding the work (already begun) of Reformation: She would have acquainted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with his attempt, and have had him diſmiſt the Court. But notwithſtanding the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to all ſuch ſorts of ill ways, ſhe had another charge by our
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62018:65"/>Mufti, though not altogether of the ſame nature, who came accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with two or three more, that were Miniſters of State, and privy Counſellors, which demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for admittance into a private Conference with the <hi>Sultana,</hi> on preſſing affairs, which oblig'd the <hi>Sultana</hi> to give them admittance. This ſecond viſit was on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that notwithſtanding a day had been prefix'd for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring on the Pilgrimage, there was ſtill ſomething or other in the wind which broke it off; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they now came with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, to terrify the <hi>Sultana</hi> into a compliance with their deſigns.</p>
                  <p>The Mufti told the <hi>Sultana</hi> that ſince the laſt time that he had the honour of entertaining her, he had been divers times to learn her reſolutions, but that not being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her preſence, and the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs they were come about preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he had aſſociated to himſelf
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62018:66"/>thoſe other worthy Perſons, to communicate an Affair, though not quite of the ſame nature as the former, yet tending to the ſame end, which was the good of the Church, and the glory of <hi>Ala.</hi> The Sultana reply'd, <hi>That ſhe was very deſirous to be inſtrumental in ſo Pious and Good a Work, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it were not by any ſiniſter ends. To wave entring upon the late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I had with you, Madam,</hi> ſaid the Mufti, <hi>we are come here to let you know, that for very high and weighty reaſons you muſt forthwith, and without any further delays, ſet forth in Pilgrimage to the Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with the Emperour, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after you have made your Offering and Devotions, give out that you are with Child: and you muſt ſo order matters, that every body may give credit to it, for thoſe very reaſons which have already been given you. And I,</hi> ſaid the Sultana, <hi>tell you for anſwer, as I
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62018:66"/>have already told you, that I will never conſent to any ſuch thing, nor impoſe upon the World thus, to the excluſion of the right Heir, without the Emperor's conſent, and I am already certain before hand, that he will never give his aſſent to ſo ill a practice. Madam,</hi> ſaid one of the Councellors, <hi>we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, for we have already been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd by the Emperor, though we have us'd all the Arguments imaginable to perſwade him to it, on the contrary, we have found ſo much and ſo great an averſion in him, towards ſuch a thing, that we deſpair ever bringing him to it; wherefore we are come, Madam, to denounce to you from his Sanctity, the Grand Mufti, that all you have done hitherto is of no value, if you perſiſt not in doing all the good you can for the advancement of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Faith; and that in lieu of gaining any advantage by what you have already done, you are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to be pronounced degraded from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62018:67"/>all the fair and aſſured hopes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory, which you were to have receiv'd in this and the other world, in caſe you had perſiſted to the end, and you are immediately to be deliver'd up to the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to do with you at his Pleaſure. Wonder not at this proceeding, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid then our Mufti, <hi>it is but juſtice, that puniſhments ſhould be in ſome meaſure proportionable to the Crime for which they are inflicted, and can there be a greater, than to (wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and meerly to gratifie ſome few ſhallow ſcruples) be the immediate cauſe of the deſtruction of ſo great a work, ſo happily begun, and ſo proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly gon on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You have no more therefore to do, but to countenance the buſineſs, to ſhape you a great belly, which you muſt increaſe as the time of your reckoning will require; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you muſt confide in three or four women, which you ſhall think fit to intruſt with ſo great a ſecret, which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62018:67"/>may aſſiſt you all the time of your feigned Breeding, and at the time of your delivery alſo. I find ſo much difficulty in all this,</hi> reply'd the Sultana, <hi>that I know not what to ſay, nor what to do, I would do much to avoid thoſe horrid threatnings which are preparing to be put in execution againſt me; but on the other hand, how is it poſſible that I ſhould in the firſt place deceive the Emperor, who being made jealous of ſome trick acted againſt his will, will be the more curious in the detection of it; and if he ſhould at any time deſire, for his ſatisfaction, to feel the ſtirring of the Child in my body, How ſhall I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him from taking that liberty of ſatisfying himſelf? Beſides, grant this was feaſable: How is it poſſible to delude ſo many great Perſons highly intereſſed in this great buſineſs, who by the Law of the Empire are to be preſent, that are of</hi> Mahomet<hi>'s Religion, and who have at preſent ſo much fears upon them, and ſo much
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62018:68"/>cauſe to ſuſpect foul play, that they will be more diligent than uſually in reſpect to the buſineſs? To this we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Madam, in the firſt place, that the very ſolemnity of the Pilgrimage, will be of great moment; next, that as to the Emperor, we foreſeeing ſuch a thing, have provided againſt that inconveniency, by letting him know, as we have done already, that we have reciv'd an Holy Ointment, with which your Belly being once rubb'd, to prevent miſcarriage, no prophane hands muſt for ever after offer to touch it till after delivery; and to that purpoſe, Madam, when you have once given out to the Emperor, that you are with Child by him, you muſt keep your ſelf ſo cloſe lapped up, that he may not, by any ſurpriſal when you are aſleep, attempt the Tryal. He is ſo exact an obſerver of all things, which the Church impoſes upon him, that after you have once aſſured him of the thing, he will be one of the firſt that will rejoice at your preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62018:68"/>and that will ſpread it abroad. And as to the other doubt you have rais'd, Madam, in the firſt place, long before hand, we ſhall get ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Women that reckon about the time we have prefixt, that amongſt them we may have a Male-Child to ſubſtitute for yours; and as to the ways of conveyance of it into the Bed to you, there are a hundred ways beſides warm Clothes, warming-pans, trapp-doors, back-doors, and private windows at the Bedshead to bring a Child in; piſh thoſe things are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd every day, eſpecially amongſt us of the Clergy, who are not permitted to marry; but becauſe the grand</hi> Mufti <hi>knows that we, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, are made of the ſame Fleſh and Blood as other men, we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the uſe of Women in private, and without giving Scandal, by which converſation it frequently happens, that we are put to ſuch and the like Shifts; then let us alone for ordering things, ſo as that none
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62018:69"/>but thoſe of our Sect ſhall be preſent, at the time of your pretended deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſome ſhall be ſent one way, others diſpers'd in other places, ſo that all will have the wiſhed for ſucceſs that we all deſire and pray for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sultana</hi> having attentively hearkned to what had been ſaid, and being beforehand terrified with thoſe horrid threatnings which they had denounc'd, conſidering within her ſelf that all the evil that was in it, they took upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that ſhe had no further end in it, but the good advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Religion, ſhe conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though yet not without ſome kind of Reluctancy; and told them, that ſince they aſſured her, that they would take upon themſelves all the evil that ſhe might fancy to be in the Action, and that they would ſtand by her always, encounter and oppoſe all the Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which the Emperor might have on this Affair; ſhe yielded to their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62018:69"/>deſires, and ſaid ſhe would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately go to the Emperor, and fix-on a certain day to ſet forth.</p>
                  <p>All things being thus agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they left the <hi>Sultana</hi> to perform her part, and every one of them went about to act theirs, in order of bringing about this grand work.</p>
                  <p>Here we ſhall leave once more the Court, to give a viſit to poor <hi>Roxana,</hi> who through the great care of thoſe that were about her, had perfectly recovered her Senſes, but was ſo melanchollick and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that ſhe avoided all Society, having no delight but to walk in her Garden, and to viſit the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merhouſe, in which ſhe had firſt ſeen her beloved <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> though not without great diſturbances; and ſome time, when it came into her mind, looking on the place where ſhe laſt ſaw him, what a diſmal ſight it was to her, to ſee him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in his own Blood. <hi>Mufti Repſet</hi> had continually from time
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62018:70"/>to time, given her Viſits, and ſuch of his Counſels and Adviſes as he thought fit, and finding her to be perfectly recovered of her alienation of mind, and fancying her more beautiful than ever, in that negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent dreſs ſhe now did wear, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after the loſs of all his Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hopes towards the <hi>Sultana,</hi> he reſolved to change his Note, and under pretence of diverting her from her deep Melancholy, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a commerce of Love, and gallantry with her. This was eaſie for him to do, for what with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty uſually allowed to Perſons of his Profeſſion, the ſmall care, or rather little Love which her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had for <hi>Roxana</hi> after this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage; and that part which <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> acted, who was the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as I have told you already, in her Brother's intereſt; the <hi>Mufti</hi> had opportunity enough, to declare his mind to <hi>Roxana,</hi> with all the Liberty and privacy imaginable.</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:62018:70"/>
                  <p>He made as much uſe of it as he poſſibly could, unto which his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Zora,</hi> who had been with <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> ever ſince her diſtraction, did not a little contribute. She was a Lady of the Town, one that lov'd much more to ſing a Lampoon, than to turn over her Beads, ſhe was for all Commerſe; all Ages, Complexions, Humours, Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo they but brought Grits to the Mill, were welcome. But above all, ſhe had a particular inclination for a brisk young man, of good Parentage, good Meen, Education, and Inclinations, but of little or no Fortune, whoſe name was <hi>Cara,</hi> and who had as little hopes of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any at Court; for being no <hi>Haliſt,</hi> and having but a ſmall ſtock of ready Caſh, wherewith to puſh on his Fortune. <hi>Zora</hi> affecting this young Man, as I have ſaid, ſhe did all ſhe could to gain his Affections, but he knowing what a courſe of life ſhe had always lead, he was
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62018:71"/>not very forward on the buſineſs, no further than to take his ſhare in the Croud, amongſt the reſt of thoſe that kept her Company. She was handſome, and of a pretty good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, but above all, ſhe was Siſter to the all-doing <hi>Repſet,</hi> the <hi>Mufti.</hi> This laſt made him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline very much to humor <hi>Zora,</hi> when he conſidered what influence ſhe had over her Brother, who was all at Court; he knew that <hi>Zora</hi> was inform'd of his Religion, and ſeeing, that notwithſtanding, that ſhe took all occaſions of expreſſing her kindneſs towards him, though ſhe never would admit him to the laſt Favour, as having other deſigns upon him particularly, he began to build upon that bottom, and on that account, did viſit her frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. She on her part, thinking that his repeated Civilities, were the pure effects of her Beauty, ſhe did all ſhe could to add luſtre to that proportion which Nature had
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62018:71"/>beſtow'd on her with a Liberal hand: Thus did <hi>Cara</hi> and <hi>Zora</hi> live in good intelligence together, which was not diſcontinu'd, when ſhe came into <hi>Aladin</hi>'s family, though ſhe was then oblig'd, to bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to that great troop of Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which ſhe formerly entertain'd, and was oblig'd to divert her ſelf by ſtealth in that Nature, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Corners. For though <hi>Aladin,</hi> like the reſt, was forced to hold a Candle to the Devil, more for fear than love or worſhip, which had made him yield to the taking of <hi>Zora</hi> into his Family at the firſt requeſt, which <hi>Repſet</hi> had made him. It was with a Reſolution of not permitting any ill thing to be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Houſe, abroad ſhe might do what ſhe pleas'd, but what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſoever ſhe was then, ſhe was to be a Saint in <hi>Aladin</hi>'s Houſe, and in this her Brother the <hi>Mufti</hi> had not loſt his aims, which were to get her a good Name again, if it
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62018:72"/>were poſſible, which he knew ſhe might as ſoon get in <hi>Aladin</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as in a Convent, which had made him take the Opportunity of offering her ſervice in the behalf of <hi>Roxana,</hi> which at that time was accepted more freely, than it might have been at any other juncture.</p>
                  <p>One day <hi>Zora</hi> ſeeing <hi>Cara</hi> paſs by <hi>Aladin</hi>'s Gates, ſhe ſent a ſlave to let him know that ſhe would ſpeak with him. He came to her, and ſhe told him, that ſhe could not doubt of the knowledge which he muſt have gain'd by this time, of her affections towards him, but to let him know that her intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were real, and that ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired her ſelf into <hi>Aladin</hi>'s ſober Family, but to give her ſelf more intirely up to him, ſhe would now at that very time preſent him to her Brother, who was then in the Houſe, and ingage him to take a particular care of him, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the Emperor ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62018:72"/>preferment, but that this ſhould be on condition that he ſhould make her a promiſe of marrying her. This word Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage did not a little ſurpriſe <hi>Cara,</hi> he was ſo diſturbed at it, that he ſtood mute, which gave time to <hi>Zora</hi> to continue thus. <hi>What are you ſo great a Libertine, as to be affrighted at a bare propoſal of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage? No, Madam, not at the word,</hi> replyed <hi>Cara, but at the thing it ſelf, for having never yet ſpent one thought that way, it now a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangles my Wits to find out an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſuitable to my thoughts, and the honour you do me. Well, I'll allow you three days,</hi> replyed <hi>Zora, to conſider of the Buſineſs;</hi> in the mean time, <hi>I will be beforehand with you, and inſtantly preſent you to my Brother.</hi> He was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning moſt humble thanks to her, when that a noiſe being heard, <hi>he is coming,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I'll go and meet him;</hi> with that ſhe ſtept towards
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62018:73"/>the <hi>Mufti,</hi> who was going out, and told him, that there was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which ſhe would recommend to his particular care, as a perſon, though no <hi>Haliſt,</hi> yet that in all other reſpects, did deſerve his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and favour. At theſe words, the <hi>Mufti,</hi> to whom good words, and fair promiſes, never coſt any thing, whatever the effects were, came to meet <hi>Cara,</hi> who was coming to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and told him, Sir, <hi>my Siſter has beforehand given me ſuch a Character of you, if your name is</hi> Cara, <hi>that will oblige me to ſerve you with the utmoſt of my power; you may firmly build on that fond, and ſo ſoon as I can poſſible, I ſhall make you ſenſible of the effects of my Promiſes; but you muſt have a little patience, my hands are full, do but put me in mind of you ſometimes, by appearing before me, or before my Siſter, and your buſineſs is done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cara</hi> was going to return him a great Complement of thanks, when
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62018:73"/>he thus interrupted him, <hi>Look you, Sir,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Mufti, I know what you would, and what you ſhould ſay, time is precious, be aſſured that I'll be as good as my word, my Siſter ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for me, and ſo Sir, your Servant.</hi> With that he took his Siſter by the hand, and led her in another Room, which made <hi>Cara</hi> retire, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on <hi>Zora</hi>'s news propoſals.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mufti</hi> had ſo heated himſelf near <hi>Roxana,</hi> who being that day in a little more pleaſing humour than uſually, with the aſſurances that her Father had given her, to carry her into the Country again; that it had added much Luſture to her natural Beauty, which of late had been clouded with the black fumes of Melancholy, upon the hopes of being in a ſhort time freed from this Prieſt's impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. She had been a little more free than ordinary in her Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had made him to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer at more Liberty than uſual; this
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62018:74"/>had ſo offended her, that ſhe had riſen from her Seat, and left the room. At which our <hi>Mufti</hi> all on a fire, had taken pet, and was gone down, to make his Complaint to his Siſter, and to acquaint her with his Reſolutions. <hi>Dear Siſter,</hi> ſaid he <hi>to her, you can no more be ignorant of the Love which I have for</hi> Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, <hi>than I am of that which you have for</hi> Cara. <hi>I have given you my word, that I will prefer him to a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Employ, and that I will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him firſt to marry you; and I here aſſure you anew, that I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all that I have promiſed you to a title; but my Dear</hi> Zora, <hi>you muſt take pity on me alſo. I muſt tell you that I can no longer live, except I enjoy</hi> Roxana. <hi>Oh! how the thought of her diſturbs my heart,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he? <hi>I have uſed all the fair means imaginable, and ſhe proves the more obdurate to all my ſupplications, to all my ſubmiſſions, and to all my Vows. What muſt I do in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:62018:74"/>There pauſing, <hi>Zora</hi> made this anſwer. <hi>Sir, I pity your condition the more, becauſe that mine is of the very ſame nature. And ſeeing you have ſo generouſly offered me your aſſiſtance, I can do no leſs than to aſſure you of mine, but ſpeak what you would have me do, and 'tis done. But remember this, both for my ſake, as well as your own, that no time muſt be loſt, becauſe</hi> Aladin <hi>has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven orders to his Servants to be in a readineſs, to march to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment three days hence; wherefore you muſt be quick in the execution of your reſolutions. For that matter,</hi> replyed the <hi>Mufti, let me alone, I, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Emperor, will eaſily deal with</hi> Aladin; <hi>and oblige him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard his Journey at my pleaſure, nay and if there is occaſion, as you will find there will be, when I have told you all; I will have him ſo ſuddenly ſent into the Country, that he ſhall not have time to take above a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or two with him, therefore Dear</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:62018:75"/>Zora, <hi>ſet your heart at Reſt, that way. But to the point. I have been thinking that ſome little forcible at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt might prevail more with</hi> Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's <hi>humour, than all other means that I have tryed yet. I know that ſome Women will be forc'd, that they may have that to ſay for themſelves, when afterwards they readily comply with our deſires. I have a great mind to try what that will do, when</hi> Aladin <hi>is gone, but without you I can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it; it is you that muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the Mother from</hi> Roxana's <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and that muſt either ſend out of doors, or employ at diſtance, all the Servants, that none may hear her Cryes, in caſe ſhe would be ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and let me alone for the reſt. I will attempt her but once more by fair means, and then I'le go to extreams.</hi> Well, Brother, <hi>ſaid Zora,</hi> be you aſſur'd of me, let it be your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to get <hi>Aladin</hi> remov'd far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from hence, againſt that time for his prying Eye, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62018:75"/>diſpoſition, would ſpoil all, and be ſure not to forget <hi>Cara.</hi> Truſt to me, dear Siſter, <hi>anſwered Repſet,</hi> and let me alone to manage things. With that he took leave of his Siſter, and went his way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aladin</hi> growing weary of the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s too frequent viſits to his Daughter, and of <hi>Zora</hi>'s Intreagues, how cloſe ſoever ſhe carry'd them, was reſolv'd to put an end to both, by retiring to his Government, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he no longer had any Buſineſs to do in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and he had diſpos'd of all things to be in a readineſs to tranſport himſelf and his whole Family thither, with a full reſolution never to let his Wife nor Daughter ſee that great City again, at leaſt ſo long as the laſt were under his Government, which he hoped would not be long, for he was reſolved to marry her out of hand, ſo ſoon as he were got down, to any Gentleman that would have her, to free himſelf
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62018:76"/>from the trouble of obſerving her. To this purpoſe, he went to the Court to ask the Emperor's leave to retire the next morning to his Government, but he was come too late. The <hi>Mufti</hi> had already influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the Emperor, that <hi>Aladin</hi>'s preſence was neceſſary for ſome time longer here, at leaſt till a particular Council were over, at which he was to aſſiſt, which would not be till two or three days hence. This had the <hi>Mufti</hi> done, that he might have the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of giving <hi>Roxana</hi> one Viſit more, in which he would uſe all the Rhetorick imaginable to gain her Affections, and which ſhould be the laſt, if he did not ſucceed. <hi>Aladin</hi> having receiv'd the Emperor's abſolute Orders not to ſtir, till that Conſultation was over, he return'd home in order to obey it, but with a firm reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſo ſoon as it were over, to be gone without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62018:76"/>leave, but take hold of the Emperor's words, who had told him he ſhould not go till that time was over; wherefore he ſtill kept all things in readineſs for his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, only acquainting with it his Wife, and <hi>Roxana,</hi> who was daily courting of him to be going, as much as the Mother had a deſire to ſtay, for ſhe thought her ſelf young enough yet to make a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure at Court.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cara</hi> all this while had leaſure to reflect on what <hi>Zora</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to him, and did not know what courſe to take. He had a fancy towards her, and would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have eſtabliſh'd a commerce of Gallantry betwixt themſelves, but when the thoughts of marrying her came in his head, that would ſo pall his appetite, that nothing could quicken it again, but the hopes that her Brother would get him into ſome conſiderable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that would again make him
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62018:77"/>reſolve not to break off wholly with <hi>Zora:</hi> in this his fluctuation of thoughts, he at laſt deſigned to ſteer a middle courſe betwixt <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis,</hi> to avoid the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rock of Matrimony, and that of want and neceſſity alſo, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>Zora</hi> a verbal promiſe of Marriage, which he would engage to perform when he was through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettled in an Employ, though he never intended it: In this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he reſolves to go ſee <hi>Zora,</hi> he finds her at <hi>Aladin</hi>'s, and lets her know that he was come to tell her that the love he had for her was ſufficient of it ſelf to oblige him to do any thing that ſhe ſhould require of him, but that he thought it prudence to be fully poſſeſs'd and fix'd in ſome Office or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy by the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s means before he married her, for fear that that being once done, the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to ſerve him ſhould ſlacken, or that he ſhould quite give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62018:77"/>all thoughts of aſſiſting him. This ſo reaſonable a requeſt did ſtop <hi>Zora</hi>'s mouth, ſo that ſhe had nothing to ſay, but that ſhe knew ſo well her Brother, that beſides the intereſt and ſhare that ſhe had, or at leaſt expected to have in the buſineſs, he was a perſon that would be as good as his word, ſo ſoon as it could be done without prejudice to the reſt of his Concerns; that in the mean time, ſhe deſired his frequent viſits, declaring that ſhe was never well pleaſed but in his company; and that he did not know how much it would oblige her and her Brother, if that he would give her a verbal aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Marrying her, as he had already promis'd, when things were ſettled to his mind. <hi>I am ſo far, Madam,</hi> replyed <hi>Cara, from refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you ſo juſt a requeſt, and ſo much conformable to my own deſires, that I will propoſe further, with your leave, to confirm this promiſe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62018:78"/>and to make it a firm marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and I. 'Tis the</hi> Mufti, <hi>that I fear, and not you; I will conſummate the Marriage by bedding you privately. You know, Madam, that Marriages are made in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that we do but ratify them here on Earth, that that is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our mutual conſents, and that the outward and pompous Ceremonies thereof are but to ſatisfy the World that ſuch a Man and ſuch a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man are going to lye by conſent with one another; and why may not we do that without all that buſtle, when our hearts have before hand agreed upon the point? I know that what you ſay, is true,</hi> replyed <hi>Zora, but ſhould you prove falſe to me after all, then ſhould I be wanting in the means to right my ſelf, which a publick Matrimony would afford me. That is an errour, Madam, give me leave to tell you,</hi> replyed <hi>Cara; for were I ſo ill inclin'd, that could not hinder me from leaving you,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62018:78"/>at leaſt, and what difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the one and the other? But you muſt not fear any ſuch thing from a Perſon that has ſo much Love and Reſpect for you as I have. Well, I find,</hi> replyed <hi>Zora, that you have a charming Tongue, which with the concurrence of my Love towards you, makes me apt to give credit to what you ſay. You way rely on me in this, Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Cara, as on an Oracle. I will be true to you, nay, to my ſelf, I ſhould ſay; for my Love to you makes me to eſpouſe your Intereſt as my own: do but conſent to afford me time and Opportunity of turning the verbal Promiſe you required of me, into an abſolute marriage, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving me into your Bed, into your arms.</hi> Well, <hi>replyed Zora,</hi> Since that I have already, long ſince, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived you into my heart, I ſhall the leſs ſtand upon terms, on the aſſurance you give me, that you will publickly own our private mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62018:79"/>when you are once firmly fixed in ſome handſome Employ, I yield to your deſires, and I will take but a day or two's time to contrive how to manage the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, that we may not be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; after which I ſhall give you notice of the time and place. In the mean time fail not to ſee me every day, and never abuſe the truſt which I put in you. <hi>Cara</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Zora</hi> with kiſſes, after which having once again aſſur'd her of his conſtancy, he went his ways.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mufti,</hi> whoſe Love to <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> did render as impatient and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as could be imagin'd, had not patience to defer the laſt tryal which he deſign'd, of his Addreſſes to <hi>Roxana;</hi> he did not fail to give her a viſit the next day, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the repulſe which he had ſo lately received from her; but ſo ſoon as ſhe had heard that the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> was return'd, ſhe had got into her Mother's Company, and would
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62018:79"/>not admit of his Viſit, but in her Mother's preſence; he was forced to comply to that, for fear of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any ſuſpicion, wherefore he went in, and fell to compliment both Mother and Daughter, but much after another manner than he had don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the day before. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he ſeem'd ſo complaiſant, that the mother was exceedingly pleas'd with his Converſation; he ſtayed the longer in hopes that in time, buſineſs would call the Mother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or that ſhe would go of her ſelf; but he was very much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that, ſhe ſtill had a Colts Tooth of her own, and the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s very eajoling of her Daughter, tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her Fancy ſo, that ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would apply the diſcourſe to her ſelf, and would anſwer accordingly, not without tacitly promiſing her ſelf, to repeat ſuch pleaſing Converſation as often as ſhe could, during her ſtay at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> At laſt the Mother
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62018:80"/>was whiſpered by a Servant, that ſome Company was come to give her a Viſit, ſhe aroſe preſently to receive them; and ſo ſoon as <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> ſaw her Mother's motion, ſhe likewiſe did riſe to follow her, but for all that ſhe could do, the <hi>Mufti</hi> did hold her ſo faſt, that ſhe was forc'd to ſtay. I find, Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that you have reſolved to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me deſperate; how cruel are you, to ſee a man, ſuch a one as I am, dye at your feet without the leaſt regret for having been the cauſe of it? If I am the cauſe of any Evil to you, <hi>replyed Roxana,</hi> I aſſure you that I am a very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent one. I ſhould be ſorry to cauſe the leaſt diſturbance to my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, much leſs would I be guilty of ſuch a Crime as you lay to my Charge, againſt a Perſon whoſe Function I Honour and Reſpect. Good, Madam, <hi>replyed the Mufti,</hi> leſs of Honour and Reſpect to the Profeſſion, and more of Love and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62018:80"/>Complaiſance to the Perſon: You know, Madam, that I adore you, I have told you more than once, that I cannot live without you, take pity of me. Sir, I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy told you I do, and I again tell you ſo, the rather, becauſe I am ſo unhappy as not to be in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of eaſing you of your trouble, what can I ſay or do more? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay my Affections and Love with yours, <hi>reply'd the Mufti,</hi> and Croſs not for ever the ſaying, that Love begets Love. Why, to tell you the truth, Sir, that Proverb is no Friend of yours, for every time I think on't I am convinc'd, that all you ſay to me is down right Gallantry and Amuſement, becauſe that I find no other Inclination in me but of ſuch like Diverſion, but not one grain of Love, I can aſſure you. The more miſerable wretch am I, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>ſaid he;</hi> it is like that ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is more happy than me, though not more in Love, nor more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving

                  <p>This uſage did quite put him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Cuſhion, he was at once in love, mad, angry, and full of ſpight. He went off with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have a full revenge of the Daughter on the Father. To that end, that very night he inform'd the Emperor, that ſome Rumours which were ſpread abroad of ſome inſurrection in or near <hi>Aladin</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, did require his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate preſence there, that in caſe there were any occaſion for it, he might quell the diſturbance, or by his preſence prevent any ſuch Deſigns, ſo that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62018:81"/>would do well to give him notice that very night to be gone early in the morning. The Emperor told him, that but the day before, he had adviſed him to retain <hi>Aladin</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> a while longer, wherefore he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at the ſudden Alteration of his Council. The <hi>Mufti</hi> anſwer'd, that theſe news having been ſpread abroad, not without ſome grounds, ſince he had given him that advice, he thought that now it was neceſſary to alter it. Well, <hi>ſaid the Emperor,</hi> ſend for him in my Name, and I'le give him orders to depart to morrow. In the Morning, Sir, <hi>ſaid the Mufti,</hi> for we know not what his delay of ſome hours might produce. Well, ſaid the Emperor, be it ſo; little dreaming of the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s aim in it, which was, that <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> might not have ſo much time, as to take his Wife and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him, which he feared he might do, with two or three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62018:82"/>and leave the reſt to follow, ſhould he have any longer time aloud him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aladin</hi> was ſent for, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Command from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, to depart the next morning early towards his Government. He was ſurpris'd at the order, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s aſſiduous viſits to his Daughter, he miſtruſted that he had a hand in the buſineſs, and that it was with a deſign to retain <hi>Roxana</hi> in town; he was the more troubled too, becauſe his Wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan alſo to hearken to the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s Tales; this made him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of <hi>Amurat,</hi> but ſo much time as to take his Wife and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with ſome few Servants, with him, aſſuring him that he would be gone in twenty four hours. The Emperor, thinking that there was not ſo great and preſſing a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for <hi>Aladin</hi>'s departure, as the <hi>Mufti</hi> had ſuggeſted, did grant him his requeſt; for which favour <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:62018:82"/>having return'd his thanks, he went home, to uſe all diligence for his depart. He preſently gave order to his Wife and his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be in a readineſs againſt next Morning, very early; he did appoint all thoſe of his Servants that ſhould go along with him, and thoſe that ſhould come after; and gave order for all other things requiſite for the Journey.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mufti</hi> was not preſent when that <hi>Amurat</hi> had granted a day longer to <hi>Aladin</hi>'s deſires, wherefore he knew nothing of that ſtop; and <hi>Aladin</hi> had been ſo cunning that he had not given any notice of it to <hi>Zora,</hi> and had forbid his Wife and Daughter to ſpeak of it, for fear ſhe ſhould have given her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome information, who would have again broke his meaſures; ſo that the <hi>Mufti</hi> at his uſual time of viſit fail'd not to come to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladin</hi>'s Houſe, as he us'd to do: he thought that now he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62018:83"/>enough from being interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Aladin;</hi> but he ſtill was in fear of the troubleſome Mother's company, which was not requiſite, on the account of his viſit to <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> but he thought that he would find a way to employ her elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. He ſtay'd not to be uſher'd in, as uſually, but briskly getting up ſtairs, humming of a tune to himſelf, as he went; he puſh'd open the door of <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ruſh'd in on the ſudden, and was ſo haſty to ſhut the door upon him, that he might not be diſturb'd by the Mother, in his laſt addreſs of Courtſhip to <hi>Roxana,</hi> that he had not perceiv'd <hi>Aladin</hi> and the Mother, who were both in the Room. You cannot but think that he was ſtrangely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compos'd at <hi>Aladin</hi>'s preſence, who he thought far off on his Journey? not in the leaſt, I aſſure you; what with his accuſtomed confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and that preſence of mind

                  <p>Though <hi>Aladin</hi> did believe all this to be a Sham, he alſo knew that the <hi>Mufti</hi> had power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence enough upon the <hi>Sultana</hi> to put in her head a deſire to ſee <hi>Roxana,</hi> for whom ſhe had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kindneſs, not doubting but that the <hi>Sultana</hi> would be glad to have an account of <hi>Roxana</hi>'s late adventures from her own mouth: this was the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion alſo; wherefore he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately addreſs'd his ſteps towards the Seraglio, and all places being open to his confidence, he ſoon found acceſs unto the <hi>Sultana,</hi> in whom he eaſily inſpir'd the deſires of ſending for <hi>Roxana</hi> and her Mother; which care he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, and having already done that part, he had no more to do, but to fix on the day of the violent attempt on <hi>Roxana,</hi> with his Siſter <hi>Zora</hi>'s aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>They both being certain that now <hi>Aladin</hi> would be oblig'd to be
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62018:84"/>gone the next morning without his Daughter, who ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home that night, by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance. They fix'd the time for the great work on the next day, about the time that <hi>Roxana</hi> came from walking in her Garden; ſhe uſually did retire into her Cloſet for a time: <hi>Zora</hi> undertook to keep the Coaſt clear; and the <hi>Mufti</hi> aſſur'd her that he would act his part like a Man of Mettle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aladin</hi> not knowing how to remedy all this, thought it his beſt way to leave all to Fortune, for the preſent; and ſo ſoon as he were got to his Government, to ſend for his Wife and Daughter; or to obtain leave to come and fetch them himſelf: mean time, he knew that it was but folly to withſtand the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s deſigns; and believing they inclin'd ſo much towards his Daughter, that by that means his Wife might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape; and <hi>Roxana</hi> having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> and her Mother were courteouſly receiv'd by the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who being crowded with viſits that day, through the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s contrivance, had not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of ſatisfying her ſelf of <hi>Roxana</hi>'s adventure, as ſhe deſir'd; that, with the Emperour's coming to partake of the relation, by the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s inſtigation alſo, made it ſo late before the <hi>Sultana</hi> was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfy'd with <hi>Roxana</hi>'s compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that ſhe oblig'd her, and her

                     <hi>Roxana</hi> was in hopes that her Father would have ſtay'd for their return, to have taken them along with him, but the Mother wiſh'd on the contrary, that he might be gone, that ſhe might enjoy more of thoſe pleaſant Converſations with the <hi>Mufti,</hi> of which ſhe had had but a ſmall reliſh, which made her mouth water for more. This that made <hi>Roxana</hi>'s ſorrow for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladin</hi>'s, departure, when ſhe was return'd home, was a matter of rejoycing for the Mother; and both believing that all was of the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s contrivance, he was bleſs'd and curs'd for it, according to the divers intereſts of the Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.</p>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62018:87"/>he flung himſelf at <hi>Roxana</hi>'s feet, who had been prevented by the <hi>Mufti,</hi> from diſcovering <hi>Cara</hi> in the Cloſet; you may imagine with what apprehenſions he remained there; <hi>Roxana,</hi> infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to find her ſelf alone with the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and the door ſhut, would have got to her Cloſet; but the <hi>Mufti</hi> taking hold of her Garment, <hi>ſaid,</hi> Can you have ſo much cruelty in you, Madam, as to let me periſh here, and not ſo much as afford me one word of Comfort? Speak, Madam, and let me know whether you doom me to life or death; there pauſing, <hi>Roxana,</hi> who could not get from him, was forced to make him this anſwer. I wonder, Sir, that notwithſtanding I have ſo frequently told you, that I ſhould eternally ſo much love the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> that I ſhould never afford to ſpare one grain of Love on any thing elſe, you will ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a fruitleſs purſuit of an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> it is neither ſafe nor juſt, for me to remain here, wherefore let me go, or I ſhall call for aid.

                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:62018:90"/>perceiving in what a danger ſhe was, and that ſhe was to expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than what the <hi>Mufti</hi> threatned, by the fierceneſs of his looks, and the fire in his Eyes, call'd out aloud for aid; at which he, with a forced ſmile, ſaid, In vain all this, I am not a perſon to do my work by halves, I once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain tell you, that no body can hear you, and that I will not loſe this fair opportunity, and this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of giving a vent to thoſe Flames, which would burn me up to aſhes, ſhould they remain any longer blazing in my breaſt. <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> made her laſt effort, to get from him, towards the door, which made the <hi>Mufti</hi> ſay, Nay then, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I muſt carry you to that Couch, with that taking her up in his Arms, notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance that ſhe could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly make, he carried her to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Couch, at which, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given a great ſhriek, ſhe ſain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away in his Arms.</p>

                  <p>When <hi>Cara</hi> had heard the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi>'s reſolution of forcing <hi>Roxana,</hi> he had deſign'd to reſcue her, though he run himſelf into great danger by it; but to diſguiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he had put upon him a long Veſt of Cloth of Silver, and flung a thick Veil over his head, and face, which conceal'd him from any bodies knowledge; ſo ſoon as he heard <hi>Roxana</hi>'s laſt ſhriek, and perceiv'd through the Key-hole, by the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s Violence, that it was time for him to come to her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; he came ſoftly out of the Cloſet, and violently forcing <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> out of the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s arms, (not without flinging him forcibly on the Floor) he laid her gently down on the Couch, went to the door and opened it, after which, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Roxana,</hi> all this without ſpeaking one word; he did what he could to bring her to life, at laſt ſhe breathed again, opened her Eyes, and perceiving a ſtrange ſhape by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62018:91"/>her, appear'd diſturb'd at it, and preſently expreſſed it more by a relapſing into a ſwoon again. <hi>Cara</hi> perceiving it, and gueſſing that it might be his Dreſs that did afflight her, while ſhe had ſtill the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of her danger upon her, he made towards the Cloſet, to lay by thoſe things he had put on, and ſo haſtily ſteal out of the Chamber unſeen; and being turn'd, he found that the <hi>Mufti</hi> was got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. He was but juſt got into the Cloſet again, when <hi>Zora</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber, who had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs been ſent there by her Brother, ſhe preſently run towards <hi>Roxana,</hi> pretending a great ſurpriſe, whom ſhe found coming to her ſelf again, which made her run into the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, to get ſome Cordials for her; <hi>Cara</hi> not knowing what to do, not to be diſcover'd, clapped on again the Vail, which he had already thrown off, and ſtanding upright againſt the Wall, without motion.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62018:92"/>So ſoon as <hi>Zora</hi> perceiv'd him at the entring into the Cloſet, ſhe made a great ſhriek, and running out as faſt as her legs would carry her, ſhe got out of the Chamber, not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Roxana,</hi> who was by that time quite out of her fainting fit. <hi>Cara,</hi> fearing that the longer he ſtaid, the more difficult it would be for him to get off without being known, made after her, out of the Chamber, and being got in a blind paſſage, he let drop his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, and as well as he could, got out of the Houſe, being perceiv'd by no body but one Slave, who was at the outward gate. <hi>Roxana</hi> having at this ſecond apparition of the Viſion, taken more notice of it, did fancy that ſhe knew that Veſt, and perceiving no body in the Room, and the door wide open, after a little pauſe ſhe got off of the Couch, went into her Cloſet, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Veſt ſhe had ſeen was wanting, having lock'd the door up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62018:92"/>her, and taken in the Key, ſhe recover'd her ſelf little by little, and buſi'd her thought in unravelling the myſtery of her great and wonderful deliverance, finding her ſelf in the ſame condition that ſhe was in before the Attempt, ſetting aſide the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that her fears, and her ſtruglings, had made in her Cloaths and mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> was not interrupted in the leaſt by <hi>Zora,</hi> ſhe had been ſo frighted, at what her Brother had told her, juſt paſſing by her, and what ſhe her ſelf had ſeen, that ſhe had not the courage to return to <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Chamber, not doubting but that <hi>Roxana</hi> would pronounce her acceſſary in her own thoughts, if not the chief Inſtrument of the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s wicked enterpriſe, and the Mother being very buſie elſe-where, in putting up things which were in her particular Cuſtody, to be ſent after <hi>Aladin,</hi> who could not take them along with him, through her abſence, when he left the City.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:62018:93"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> had full leiſure to reflect on the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s bold attempt, and on the ſtrangeneſs of her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſhe remembred how near ſhe was being raviſh'd, when paſt hopes of all aſſiſtance, the door be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lock'd on the inſide by her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher, but could not retrieve how it came to paſs that ſhe had remain'd untouch'd, her raviſher gone, the door left open, and ſhe delivered from all her fears, and apprehenſions, when there was no body by. Then again ſhe could not imagin who ſhould be the Perſon, that ſhould get into her Cloſet, how it came open, and wherefore they ſhould go out, without ſaying any thing to her, with one of her Veſts on, and one of her Veils over their face; all theſe things appear'd more like a Dream or a Viſion to her than a Reality, ſhe would have inclined to believe it ſo, had not ſhe miſt her Veſt, and her Vail; and ſtill remained ſenſible of the diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62018:93"/>and diſorders ſhe was in. She had a great deſire to inform her ſelf of all theſe things from <hi>Zora,</hi> but ſhe wondred that ſhe came not near her, and conjecturing by that, that it was her guilt which made her not to appear; ſhe could not tell which way to begin to open the buſineſs to her. She was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s boundleſs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he who had had ſo much impudence, as to attempt ſo horrid a violence upon her Chaſtity, in her own houſe too, would not be wanting to himſelf, by ſome means or other, of ſhifting his neck out of the Collar; nay, ſhe even ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that if ſhe ſhould make a noiſe of it, he would not ſtick to turn all the ill of the buſineſs upon her ſelf, and that what with his tongue, his impudence, and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant over the Emperor, the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi> and the chiefeſt of the Court, he would ſo manage things, that he ſhould be counted innocent, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62018:94"/>ſhe guilty. In this perplexity of thought ſhe knew not what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon; ſhe continu'd ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on the buſineſs, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Reſolution, till her Mother finding the Chamber door open, did ſtep in to ſee for her Daughter, after whom ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; not ſeeing her in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhe call'd, to know whether ſhe was retir'd into her Cloſet; <hi>Roxana</hi> hearing her Mother's voice, open'd the Door, and her Mother briskly telling her, that ſhe had been a great while very buſie in ſending her Father's things after him; it put her quite off of giving any account of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, and from that Moment, ſhe reſolv'd to make no noiſe about it, at leaſt for ſome time, till ſhe had got as much light into the Buſineſs as ſhe could poſſibly attain to.</p>
                  <p>The Mother asked her whether the <hi>Mufti,</hi> according to his Cuſtom, had not ſeen her that day? <hi>Truly,</hi>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:62018:94"/>ſaid ſhe, not giving her Daughter time to anſwer, <hi>he is a man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Converſation, and conſidering, that no Scandal can happen from the viſits of a Perſon of his Profeſſion, though never ſo frequently repeated, I muſt confeſs, that I ſhould take as much delight in that ſort of Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as in any other that I know.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> was ſo vext at the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her Mother's Diſcourſe, which was very unſeaſonable at that time to her, that ſhe was ſcarce able to give her Mother the reſpect ſhe owed her: She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd not to ſtir out of her Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet till ſhe would go to Bed, and ſee whether <hi>Zora</hi> would come to her of her own accord, by which ſhe might gueſs whether ſhe had a hand in her Brother's late At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, as ſhe queſtion'd not but ſhe had; but whether ſhe had or had nor, as ſhe made a reſolution
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62018:96"/>in her ſelf never to give the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> the liberty of ſpeaking more with her, ſo ſhe deſign'd to leave <hi>Zora</hi> behind her, ſo ſoon as her Father ſhould ſend or come to fetch her into the Country, which he had promiſed her he would in a Letter which he had left behind him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mufti</hi> being got home, and retir'd privately into his Cloſet, to conſider how to come off clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſo foul a buſineſs, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven order to his Servants to ſay to any that ſhould ask after him, he was not within. Of all the whole buſineſs, that which he could by no means apprehend, was the manner of <hi>Roxana</hi>'s reſcue from his embraces, when he was ſo near accompliſhing his buſineſs; he could not tell what to make of it: ſome times he thought that he had not ſhut the door, then when he aſſur'd himſelf he had, he fancied that there was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62018:96"/>ſome ſecret door belonging to <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Chamber, which he had never heard of, nor <hi>Zora</hi> neither, or that ſhe certainly would have ſecur'd it, or given him notice of it; then again he fancied that in the great haſte he had made to get up and away, to the beſt of his remembrance, he had ſeen the Cloſet door open, and why might it not be ſome body that was in that Cloſet that had thus daſh'd all his hopes in pieces? That he thought the moſt probable of all the conjectures which he could make: But then, how that Perſon ſhould come to be there, to what end, what buſineſs he had to do in <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Cloſet, and why in ſuch a ſtrange kind of diſguiſe, for he made no queſtion but that it was a Man, by the roughneſs with which he had been handled by him. All theſe queſtions which he made to himſelf were unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable; the moſt that he could
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62018:97"/>make of it was, that he believ'd that ſome Man was employ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome buſineſs or other in the Cloſet, and that not willing to be known, he had come to <hi>Roxana</hi>'s reſcue unexpected, and after that, return'd about his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: This gave him apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he might have a greater and more difficult game to play, in the diſcovery of the Perſon, and ſtopping of his mouth, than in appeaſing of <hi>Roxana:</hi> this did perplex him infinitely, inſomuch that he knew not which way to go about to purge himſelf from all guilt. After he had taken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers turns in his Chamber, then return'd into his Cloſer, it being neceſſary that he ſhould go about juſtifying himſelf without delay, he at laſt took up the reſolution of writting a Letter to <hi>Roxana,</hi> which he would incloſe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Siſter, and ſend it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by his Servant, to be

But after all, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, when you have given all that is due to your juſt reſentments, and your revenge, let me adviſe and intreat you to allow juſtice its due alſo, and after you have treated me like a Criminal, ſo long as you had no other reaſon but to believe me ſo, you ought to receive again ſome good impreſſions of me, in your heart and mind, when you are well inform'd of my Innocence, and of the Violence that I was forced to uſe upon my ſelf, before I could ſubmit to become the Inſtrument by which you have receiv'd ſo much trouble. For who durſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt long in the refuſal of the expreſs orders of the Emperor, eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had ſo highly incens'd him at my refuſal to obey him, in a thing of ſuch a nature, which I knew would ſo highly offend you? Yes, Madam, <hi>Amurat</hi> being overcome with your
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62018:99"/>Beauty, had a deſire to know whether you had not been defiled by <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſo as to have been rendered unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Honour of his Embraces; he choſe that way of Tryal, and he forc'd me to go about it. I have not yet given him an account of what I have done, and I wait to learn from you what I ſhall anſwer, according to the Inclination you may have of becoming his Miſtreſs or not. For my part, I know how to think of you, and how to value ſo chaſt and ſo virtuous a Woman, and if I durſt give Counſel againſt my Prince, I know what I would adviſe you to do. But, Madam, your own Chaſt thoughts are ſufficient to inſpire you with ſuch an Anſwer, as is fitting and ſuitable to ſo much goodneſs as you are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of. Leave me not long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an anſwer, that I may frame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly my report to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. I doubt not, but after this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, of the reaſons of my raſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt you, you will take care
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62018:100"/>to clear me from being cenſur'd by that Perſon that inſolently took the reſt of the work out of my hands, juſt when I was going to deſiſt from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further proſecution of that in which you had ſo intirely ſatisfi'd me, that you might have ſeen that my Commiſſion ending there, I had no more to do, than beg your pardon for what I had done, ſo much againſt my own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and that profound reſpect which I have for ſo Charming a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Reaſons how plauſible they might appear to the <hi>Mufti</hi> and <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> did ſo ill conſiſt with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he had taken, the Violence he had us'd, the paſſion, or rather rage, that he had expreſt, during the attempt, and his former luſtful ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations, beſides thoſe paſſionate Expreſſions in the Letter, that <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> did but admire at his Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that employed <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Name and Commands, to juſtifie
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62018:100"/>his Beaſtlineſs; upon that ſhe tore the Letter in a thouſand pieces, and confirm'd her ſelf in the Reſolution of never more giving him the leaſt opportunity imaginable of ſpeaking to her, and preſently taking Pen Ink, and Paper, ſhe writ to <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> to moſt humbly and earneſtly intreat him to come, and deliver her from that Miſery ſhe liv'd in, through the wicked <hi>Mufti</hi>'s means, and immediately diſpatch'd a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger with the Letter to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Having thus ſettled her mind again, ſhe call'd for ſome of her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants to put her in Bed. <hi>Zora</hi> thought that a fit time to appear in, before <hi>Roxana,</hi> becauſe that ſhe thought ſhe would not take notice of any thing, before her other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and that ſo ſoon as ſhe were in Bed, ſhe would retire to her Chamber; ſo that ſhe might ſee and gueſs by her looks, at the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of her Heart, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62018:101"/>as ſhe ſhould find occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Servants being come, <hi>Zora</hi> appear'd alſo with the Veſt and Vail which had been found in the dark Corner. <hi>Look you, Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>what has been found in the dark Paſſage! Can you tell who laid them there,</hi> replyed Roxana? <hi>If you could do that you would pleaſure me for I am ſure that I am infinitely oblig'd to that Perſon, who ever he be, that took the pains to carry them ſo far, and I wiſh he had them for his pains. They are worth acceptance, I aſſure you, Madam,</hi> ſaid Zora. <hi>If you think ſo,</hi> replyed Roxana, <hi>do ſo much for me, as to make a ſtrict enquiry all about the Houſe, to find out the Perſon, and if you can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, preſent them from me to him, but if you cannot learn who it is, pray accept of them your ſelf. Rexana</hi> ſpoke this with ſomething of Chearfulneſs, which made <hi>Zora</hi> to believe that <hi>Roxana</hi> had accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s Reaſons as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62018:101"/>That made her venture to ask her, whether ſhe deſign'd an anſwer to the Letter ſhe had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiv'd, for which there was a Servant waited below. <hi>No,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Roxana, <hi>I leave it to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons own diſcretion, that writ it, who is too well ſupply'd with that, to want my advice, and not to act in it for the better, as he ſhall think fit.</hi> Saying this ſhe went in Bed, and ordered that the Curtains ſhould be cloſe ſhut, and no noiſe made, becauſe ſhe would go ſleep, which oblig'd all the Servants to retire, and <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> with them.</p>
                  <p>All that <hi>Zora</hi> could do, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie her own Curioſity, and to ſerve her Brother, in the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Deliverer, was to no effect. No body in all the Houſe could give her an account of him, only a ſlave told her, that about ſuch a time, he had ſeen a Man go out of the Houſe haſtily, whom he knew not. She fancied
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62018:102"/>it might be <hi>Cara,</hi> who after his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual manner, coming to give her a Viſit, and not finding her, was gone back again to his Lodgings. To be certain of this, ſhe preſently diſpatch'd a Servant to him, to let him know that ſhe would ſpeak with him, and in caſe he was not at home, to leave word that he ſhould come to her, ſo ſoon as he was come in, or very early the next morning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi>'s dubious anſwer, did work very much in <hi>Zora</hi>'s mind, and ſhe thought that it would do ſo in her Brother's alſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſent word of it in writing to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and inform'd him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, of all that ſhe could; this made the <hi>Mufti</hi> to come to <hi>Aladin</hi>'s houſe that very night, to conſult with his Siſter, what was to be done, and upon that to take new Meaſures, in the purſuance of his firſt deſigns, to which he was two much wedded, to ever leave them
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62018:102"/>unaccompliſhed. <hi>Zora</hi> acquainted him with all that ſhe knew, and he repeated to her all that he had done, and the reſult was, that leaſt <hi>Roxana</hi> ſhould by ſome means or other, break all their Meaſures, the <hi>Mufti</hi> ſhould make another attempt upon her, but with more Craft, and leſs of force. To this end it was concluded, that the <hi>Mufti</hi> ſhould provide a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of ſome choice prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Opium, by which it ſhould be quicken'd in its operation, and weaken'd in its taſte, and that <hi>Zora</hi> ſhould adminiſter it to <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> in that Diſh of Coffee, which ſhe uſed to take every night go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bed. The time to do this was appointed to be the following Night, and the hour, when all the reſt of the Family were retir'd. After this the <hi>Mufti</hi> return'd home, and <hi>Zora</hi> went to her Bed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cara</hi> all this while had not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted matter to buſie his thoughts
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62018:103"/>with, but above all, he had been wondring at the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to which he doubted not but <hi>Zora</hi> did aſſiſt, and at the fair eſcape which he had made out of the Cloſet, without being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, after he had had the good Fortune to prevent the Execution of ſo great a piece of Villany, and the happineſs of ſerving <hi>Roxana</hi> in ſo high a meaſure. He did not doubt but that <hi>Zora</hi> had as Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inclinations as her Brother, but yet her Beauty prevail'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, and when he repreſented to himſelf, her amiable Perſon, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſerve his turn, but the enjoyment of that, at what rate ſoever, upon which he was fully bent, though not at ſo dear a rate, as to be tyed to her in Matrimony. He went to bed alſo in thoſe thoughts, and in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to obey her Summons the next morning.</p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:62018:103"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cara</hi> in the Morning came to <hi>Aladin</hi>'s houſe, where he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd by <hi>Zora,</hi> whether he had been the day before to viſit her; for that ſhe having been buſied that day more than ordinary, in aſſiſting <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Mother to put up thoſe things which <hi>Aladin</hi> had left behind him, and to ſend them away, he might have been there, and not ſee her. <hi>Cara,</hi> to take from her all diſtruſt of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s late attempt, did tell her, that earneſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs having call'd him elſewhere, he had been defective in that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for which he came to beg her pardon, and know what was her pleaſure with him. She told him that there was nothing more in it, than to know why he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in performing the promiſe which he had made her of daily viſiting her. <hi>I would add,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd <hi>Zora, that peradventure, I thought it long ſince I had ſeen
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62018:104"/>you, but that I fear you would take advantage of it. Yes, Madam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Cara, I would, and do ſo; and I now moſt earneſtly beg that you would be ſo juſt to your ſelf and me, as immediately to appoint the happy moment in which I am to dye in your embraces; the time you had taken for it, is expired: and if you would not have me to dye for love preſently at your feet, my dear</hi> Zora, <hi>ſpeak that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py moment. You are in haſte, it ſeems,</hi> replyed <hi>Zora? Yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> anſwered <hi>Cara; and I had already deſigned to wait on you, to demand the performance of your word, before I receiv'd your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; becauſe I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall be oblig'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your Brother, the</hi> Mufti, <hi>in his journey after the Court, which ſets forth to morrow. Well,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Zora, you ſhall prevail; but remember your promiſe; at twelve this Night come into that Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62018:104"/>where</hi> Aladin <hi>uſed ſometimes to lye, when here, by the door of the Gallery, which ſhall be left o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and there I ſhall be ready to receive you; but be ſure, you let no body ſee you, and that you make no noiſe. I know the Chamber,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Cara, and I ſhall fly to your embraces as a miſerable Slave would do to his unhop'd for Freedom.</hi> This bargain made, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd it with kiſſes, and ſo part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the appointed time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> having had a very reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs night, being affrighted with horrid Dreams, did reſolve not to lye any longer in her own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at leaſt for a while, till her mind were more quiet: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo ſoon as ſhe was up, ſhe order'd that all things ſhould be remov'd from her Chamber, that ſhe ſhould want, into that in which her Father us'd to ſleep, as being more remote from noiſe, and that the ſight of thoſe places
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62018:105"/>in her own Room, in which ſhe had been ſo highly offended, might not affect her Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſuch fancies as ſhe had had the laſt night. This remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val being come to <hi>Zora</hi>'s ears, ſhe preſently ſent a Meſſenger to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> to inform him of it; and another to <hi>Cara,</hi> with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which ſhe let him know that it having been <hi>Roxana</hi>'s plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to change Chambers with her for a night or two, becauſe ſhe ſlept not well in her own; that ſhe ſent him that timely notice of it, that in lieu of her own Chamber, he ſhould go further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Chamber, ſtill by the Gallery door, where he ſhould find his <hi>Zora.</hi> But the time ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long to <hi>Cara</hi> till night, he was gone out on viſits, to divert himſelf, and make the time leſs tedeous; ſo that the Letter was left to be given him with a Servant of his, who forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62018:105"/>to deliver it at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home: <hi>Cara</hi> was by that means left wholly ignorant of the change.</p>
                  <p>The Meſſenger who had been ſent to the <hi>Mufti</hi> had had better ſucceſs, he had deliver'd the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s own hands, had waited for an anſwer, which he brought back to <hi>Zora,</hi> with the ingredient which ſhe was to mix in <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Coffee. All things did thus tend little by little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their determination on the three Lovers accounts, who were all very impatient of the arrival of the happy moment in which they were to conſummate their Joyes; but above all did the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> grow impatient, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Summons from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to give his attendance there forthwith, to deliberate of the meaſures that ſhould be taken to keep the diſcontented and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring People quiet, during the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62018:106"/>of the Court: the Buſineſs being of very great concern, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired alſo a long and vigorous debate about the means that were beſt to be us'd: the Council on this buſineſs was divided, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, according as his own particular Intereſt guided him, gave his voice for this or that way, Our <hi>Mufti</hi> did all he could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bring things to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, but could not prevail; he had divers times made offers to retire, (it growing towards the hour of his aſſignation) but had been oblig'd as often to ſit down again, by <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Command; at laſt, the Council having made an end of the buſineſs in hand, broke up, and our <hi>Mufti</hi> was let looſe to his own deſires; he made all the haſte that he could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his own Lodgings, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelf a little fit for the great Work he had in hand, but the hour appointed being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cara</hi> had not fail'd to come at the critical minute to enjoy his dear <hi>Zora,</hi> who having before hand taken all her meaſures with the <hi>Mufti,</hi> ſo that he was not to ſee her any more that night, but go directly to find <hi>Roxana</hi> in <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi>'s Chamber, ſhe had retir'd her ſelf in <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Chamber, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of her dear <hi>Cara</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Cara</hi> having got into the Houſe by the back door, which anſwered to the Gallery, he had pull'd it cloſe after him, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpring-Lock, it had ſhut of it ſelf; he addreſs'd his ſteps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Aladin</hi>'s Chamber, as he had been directed, and coming to the door, which he found upon the Latch, he open'd it, went in, ſhut it again, undreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and went to bed to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs <hi>Zora,</hi> as he ſuppos'd. He
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62018:107"/>began his Careſſes, and whiſper'd fine things in her Ear; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no return, neither in word, nor in actions, and perceiving that ſhe was ſo faſt aſleep, that all he ſaid or did could not awake her, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that <hi>Zora</hi> did obſerve that ſilence, either to prevent him from making a noiſe, or that it was in point of modeſty; wherefore he troubled himſelf no further, but fell about the buſineſs that he was come for: he was ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd in ſeveral reſpects. He found not that complyance and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance which he with reaſon did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from <hi>Zora;</hi> on the contrary, he met with a kind of repulſe and oppoſition, which though not very vigorous and ſtrong, was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and which came from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as if it deſign'd a more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſiſtance, had ſhe not been overcome by a profound ſleep, which was accompanied with a louder voice than was requiſite to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62018:107"/>be heard at ſuch a time, and which was ſo forc'd and inarticulate, as thoſe perſons that in their Dreams offer to ſpeak, but cannot; but that which ſurpriſed him above all, was to find that which he leaſt expected, namely, a Virgon: he left making reflections till another time, and as he had done the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs he was come about, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſon, whoe'er it was, to awaken more and more, ſo that ſhe began to cry out, he haſtned all he could to ſlip on his cloaths, and to get away in all diligence, for fear of any ſurprizal; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very deſirous to know with whom he had had to do, he had flipp'd a Ring off the Perſon's Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which he took along with him; he preſently got to the door he had come in at, and getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Court-yard, through which he was to paſs before he came to the Street, there he eſpied a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muffled up, who turn'd aſide,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62018:108"/>as having no deſire to be known, he paſſed by, and went his way home, contented with his preſent good fortune, and wonderfully ſurpris'd at his good ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>The Perſon that <hi>Cara</hi> had ſeen in the Court was the <hi>Mufti,</hi> who having found the door ſhut, had walk'd up and down there, in hopes it ſhould be open'd to him. The deſire he had of concealing himſelf, and the haſte which <hi>Cara</hi> had made away, had hindred the <hi>Mufti</hi> from perceiving who it was; he went in, and being got into the Gallery, he found <hi>Zora</hi> very much diſorder'd, who was running for help, who told him that <hi>Roxana</hi> was waken'd in a ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, that through ſome dream, or the effects of what had bin gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her; ſhe talk'd very loud of ſtrange things, and that certainly ſhe would make ſome ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, of what had paſſed betwixt them, if he found not ſome preſent

                  <p>It being yet very Early, ſo that ſhe found no body about the Houſe, ſhe went rummaging on, ſtill cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, where is the Thief, where is the Raviſher, where is that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil who has depriv'd me of my Jewel? I muſt have it again, I muſt find it, nay, I will have it, I'll to the Emperor, and make my moan to him, ſure he will redreſs me; all this ſhe ſaid, going up and down and ſtriking with the Scimiter as ſhe went along; this noiſe awaken'd at laſt ſome of the Women, who wondring what was the matter, hearing <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Voice, ſtepp'd out to ſee, but ſo ſoon as ſhe eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt, running at her as well as ſhe could, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man made her eſcape into <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Mother's Chamber, where having ſhut her ſelf in, ſhe told the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what ſhe had ſeen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana,</hi> with the haſte ſhe had
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62018:110"/>made, running after the Woman, had fallen down, and could not get up again, which made ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Women with the Mother, who had been awaken'd at the allarm, to venture upon her, and having taken by force the Scimiter from her, they took her up, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themſelves as well as they could from her Teeth and Nails, and conveyd her to her Mother's Bed, being the neareſt at hand, where ſhe was forc'd to be held with meer ſtrength of Arms.</p>
                  <p>After the Mother had a little recollected her ſelf, ſhe caus'd ſome body to go call <hi>Zora</hi> to her; the Meſſengers were knocking at the door till they were weary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any anſwer, which made them look through the Key-hole, and by an imperfect dim light, it being yet early, having perceiv'd her fallen on the ground, and a great deal of Blood about her, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily run back to the Mother, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62018:110"/>told her that <hi>Zora</hi> lay murthered on the Floor, in her own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and that the Door being look'd within ſide, there was no coming at her.

She was asked who had done her the miſchief? and the queſtion being made by thoſe that were inferior to her, ſhe thought not fit to give them any account of it, but wav'd the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

                     <hi>Roxana,</hi> in the mean time, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving amongſt the reſt of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant talk, mention'd the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi>'s Name two or three times. The Mother having given ſtrict Charge ſhe ſhould be held in her Bed, did go to <hi>Zora</hi>'s Chamber, to ſee her, and to ask her ſome queſtions. She asked of her, in the firſt place, <hi>who had ſo wounded her,</hi> to which <hi>Zora</hi> made anſwer, <hi>that having heard a great noiſe in the Womens apartment, ſhe had ſtepped out of her Chamber to ſee what was the matter, and that as ſhe was returning, ſhe had met with</hi> Roxana, <hi>who calling her Robber and Thief, had given her that blow with a Scimiter that ſhe had in her hand, at which ſhe had run away, and locked her ſelf in her Chamber, for fear ſhe ſhould follow after her, to give her more.</hi> The Mother asked her, <hi>whether the Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti her Brother, had been there that day,</hi> to which <hi>Zora</hi> made anſwer, <hi>No. Are you very ſure of that,</hi> ſaid
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62018:111"/>the Mother, <hi>Yes, Madam,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Zora, <hi>and I am certain, that no body in all the Houſe can ſay he has been ſeen by them this day. He may have been here, and you not know it,</hi> reply'd the Mother. <hi>No, Madam, anſwered</hi> Zora, <hi>I can, and will give you ample proof of what I ſay. And pray, Madam,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>becauſe my Wound will not permit me to write, call but for ſome body that can, and I will ſend the</hi> Mufti <hi>word, that he ſhould give us an exact account of the places and Company he has been with all the Day, and all the night.</hi> A perſon being brought, <hi>Zora</hi> bid him only write, <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your ſelf, and give good proofs where you have been of late.</hi> This was preſently ſent by <hi>Zora's</hi> ſpecial order, to her Brother, who was found in his Bed. By this time the Surgeons being come, they took <hi>Zora</hi> in hand, and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her Wound.</p>

                  <p>No ſooner did the <hi>Mufti</hi> read that note, but he preſently got up, though it was ſo early, and he began his Certificate, which was, that having been at the Council till paſt twelve of the Clock, he had from thence gone home, from whence he had not ſince ſtirr'd out. This was ſign'd by all his Servants. Of truth there was but one, who knew of his going out, who was his Conſident, the others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving really that he had not been out that night. So ſoon as it was convenient for him to ſtir forth, he went to divers of the Counſellors, and obtain'd from them their hands to certifie, that he had been with them in the Council Chamber, till after twelve, telling them, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Curioſity, that a wager depended upon it; after that he went to all the other places where he had been all that day, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd from thoſe Perſons in whoſe Company he had been, to ſign to his Certificate, which he ſent back to <hi>Zora.</hi>

                  <p>He thought this a very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing for him to do out of hand, becauſe the Court was moving that day, towards the Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that he might be ſo far juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the World, that he ſhould not in his abſence be accuſed of a deed, which he verily believ'd was done, but knew not by whom, and had no hand in it, with hopes, that at his return, he might renew his Friendſhip with <hi>Roxana,</hi> who ſtill ſtuck at his heart, though he believ'd her raviſh'd. Thus he fitted himſelf for the Journey, and went with the Court. The Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans having adminiſter'd things to <hi>Roxana,</hi> in order to compoſe her Spirits, and to cauſe her to reſt.

                  <p>The Mother not knowing what to think of all this, nor what to make of it, began to wiſh her ſelf in the Country with her Husband, or he with her at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to dive a little deeper than ſhe could in all theſe Myſteries, and to unravel the Riddles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cara,</hi> for his part, having got by his change, was well ſatisfied, fancying that it was with <hi>Roxana</hi> that he had met in the dark, in lieu of <hi>Zora,</hi> of which he hoped to be one day fully ſatisfyed, by the Ring which he had taken from off her Finger; nothing did trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him in all this buſineſs, but the loſs of his Scimiter, which he knew not whether he had dropt by the way, or left behind him,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62018:113"/>through his extreme haſte to get away unſeen, which he had almoſt deſpair'd to do, by the great noiſe which <hi>Roxana</hi> began to make.</p>
                  <p>By this time of the day, the Emperour and the <hi>Sultana</hi> were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to go their Journey, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the principal Officers of the Court, not forgetting our <hi>Mufti</hi> amongſt the reſt.

But the Emperour calling particularly for him, he was forc'd to go, and leave all to <hi>Zora</hi>'s care, which was to ſend him word how things were; but he reſolv'd to take <hi>Cara</hi> along with him, to prevent him from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further progreſs in his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with <hi>Roxana,</hi> under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of having then more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to preſent him to <hi>Amu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:62018:114"/>and to get him ſome employ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana,</hi> who was all this while in her Mother's bed, had at laſt fallen aſleep, and by the aſſiſtance of thoſe Remedies which had been adminiſtred to her, all that had paſs'd, that had been done to her, or that ſhe had acted, did appear as a Viſion; and had ſhe not found in her ſelf ſo great a change, which of neceſſity did perſwade her that there was but too much reality in the caſe, all had paſs'd with her for a Dream. She ſtill inſiſting on the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s violence to her, <hi>Zora</hi> gave <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Mother that Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate which her Brother had ſent, and the Mother having read it, ſhe gave it to <hi>Roxana,</hi> who having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd the Witneſſes names over and over, could not but be ſatisfi'd in that reſpect, not doubting, but all thoſe hands were true: the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> as wicked as he was, not daring to counterfeit ſo many Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors hands, which would of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62018:114"/>have riſen up in judgment againſt him, and have declar'd him a perſon not fit to live.</p>
                  <p>Thus was <hi>Roxana</hi> ſtill in the dark, as to the knowledge of her Raviſher; but though ſhe found that the <hi>Mufti</hi> was not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Perſon, ſhe ſuſpected that it was his, and his Siſter's contrivance and deſign, but that by ſome ſtrange accident ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had made uſe of an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which Fortune had preſented to them. She enquir'd what was become of the Scimiter, with which ſhe had wounded <hi>Zora,</hi> and deſir'd to ſee it: it was brought to her, and ſhe neither knew how ſhe had come by it, nor whoſe it might be; ſhe only learn'd that no body in all the Family could remember to have ſeen ſuch a one in all the Houſe: and <hi>Zora</hi> did believe that ſhe came out of <hi>Aladin</hi>'s Chamber with it. <hi>Roxana</hi> laid up the Scimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſafe, that when time ſhould
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62018:115"/>ſerve, ſhe might make what uſe ſhe could of it, in order to ſome diſcovery. Preſently after, calling for water to waſh her hands, ſhe miſs'd the Ring off of her Finger; ſhe ſaid nothing of that, but would go her ſelf into <hi>Aladin</hi>'s Chamber, to ſeek after it; being got thither, ſhe caus'd all that had come with her to retire; ſhe lock'd her ſelf in, and left no corner unſearch'd, both for the Ring, and the Scimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Scabbard, but to no purpoſe; ſhe then conſidered how all things lay in that Chamber, the great diſorder the bed-cloths were in; and prying a little further, ſhe perceiv'd ſome ſigns of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which had been us'd againſt her; whence ſhe concluded, that whoever it was that had been there, he had deſigndly taken her Ring away, but left the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter by accident, with haſte to get away unſeen. After this, ſhe concluded that ſomething had been
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62018:115"/>given her, to caſt her in a Sleep or Trance, that ſhe might not make that noiſe and reſiſtance which they might expect ſhe would have done; and who could do all this without <hi>Zora</hi>'s privacy? Then remembring that ſhe had complain'd to her of an odd taſte in the laſt Coffee ſhe took at night, that confirm'd her ſtill more in the belief that all had been acted by <hi>Zora,</hi> with a deſign to aſſiſt her Brother in the purſuit of his firſt Deſign, of getting from her by force, what he could not obtain by fair means, but that he being detain'd about ſome other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, ſome other Perſon more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately had met with what the <hi>Mufti</hi> had ſo long ſought for, and had made uſe of the fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that preſented it ſelf to him, not troubling himſelf who was the Perſon; and that as a great argument that ſhe conjectur'd right, it was obſervable, that no
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62018:116"/>body but her Mother and <hi>Zora</hi> did know of her lying in <hi>Aladia</hi>'s Chamber that night, where ſhe had never lain before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> having made thoſe, and divers other reflections, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to her Mother's Chamber, where ſhe declar'd all that had happen'd to her, and all the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſals that ſhe had made upon the buſineſs; concluding, that ſeeing of neceſſity, <hi>Zora</hi> muſt be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Inſtrument in all the buſineſs of her ruine, ſhe would never ſee her Face more, no more than her Brother, the wicked <hi>Mufti;</hi> and ſhe earneſtly begg'd of her Mother to adviſe <hi>Zora</hi> to retire from their Houſe, becauſe ſhe had conceiv'd a prejudice againſt her, which would hinder her perfect recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the ſight of her. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſpeak to <hi>Zora</hi> about it, and <hi>Zora</hi> knowing her ſelf guilty, and that <hi>Roxana</hi> was very like to revenge her ſelf on her, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62018:116"/>of her Brother, ſhe ſtay'd not to be bid to go twice; and that very day, ſhe retir'd to the Houſe of a Relation of hers, and <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> liv'd with her Mother a more retir'd life than ever: all her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion being in walking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in her Garden, ſitting a while in the Summer-houſe, and the reſt of her time ſhe ſpent in Sighs and Tears, in her own Chamber and Cloſet.</p>
                  <p>The Court had not been gone a Month, but that a Rumor run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout every where, that the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was with Child; and there were divers perſons that did not ſtick to affirm, and offer to lay wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that it was of a young Prince. This made all the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s and other Grandees of the Port, and of the Empire, who were not of the Sect of <hi>Hali</hi> to look about them; they had very well inform'd themſelves of the Emperor and the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Phiſicians, that ſhe could not bring
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62018:117"/>forth a living Child, which made them conclude that theſe Rumors were ſpread abroad but to feel the pulſe of the People, and to find how it would be reſented by thoſe that were more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Preſently a private Meſſenger was ſent to Prince <hi>Soliman,</hi> of that wicked practice againſt his right to the Succeſſion of the Empire. He was of the blood of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> had married <hi>Zelinda,</hi> the Eldeſt of the two Daughters which <hi>Amurat</hi> had had by a former <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi> who was of the true anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Religion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and who had had her Children educated the ſame way. The youngeſt had been married to another Prince, of the ſame Religion alſo. The Prince return'd them thanks for the time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advice which they had given him; and he further deſir'd them to continue their good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, in giving him from
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62018:117"/>time to time, ſuch intelligences and advices as might conduce to their own good as well as his, aſſuring them that he would ſtand by them againſt all Attempts which ſhould be made againſt their Religion, Laws, and Liberties.</p>
                  <p>This anſwer was ſo agreeable to their Wiſhes, which they receiv'd from Prince <hi>Solyman,</hi> that it did not only revive their drooping Spirits, but ſet them all to work themſelves, and, by Spyes upon <hi>Amurat,</hi> and the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Perſon, to find out all that they could of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt the Empire, and they at laſt found that <hi>Cha-Abas</hi> the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Emperor had ſo poiſon'd the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s mind by divers rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, great aſſurances of his Aid and <hi>Succor</hi> in the great Work of Reformation (as he call'd it,) and the continual Solicitations of his Penſioners, and Emiſſaries in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, that they no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er doubted of their deſigned ruine,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62018:118"/>and that they were ſold with the Empire to <hi>Cha-Abas</hi>'s Ambition. They gain'd ſome of the Ladies of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, whoſe places oblig'd them to be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly near the <hi>Sultana</hi> in the <hi>Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> to obſerve her exactly, and to give them from time to time, what reports they could, concerning her feigned pregnancy.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor and the <hi>Sultana,</hi> having finiſhed their Pilgrimage and Devotions, the Court return'd to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with great joy, the Emperor and <hi>Sultana</hi> declaring publickly that ſhe was with Child; for which, great joy was expreſſed amongſt all the Followers of the Sect of <hi>Haly,</hi> and our <hi>Mufti</hi> was none of the backwardeſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the wonderful Miracle. But that did not hinder him from minding his own concerns, and learning the reaſons of <hi>Zora's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from <hi>Aladin</hi>'s Family. She told him all that ſhe did know,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62018:118"/>and all that had paſſed in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but ſhe did not know how the Certificate which he had ſent, was taken, becauſe that ſhe had gone from thence that very day. She after that asked him news con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Cara,</hi> he told her that he had for her ſake, <hi>got him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Galley, and that he was gone to enter upon it, that after that he would return to</hi> Conſtantinople. With this ſtory he pleaſed her for the preſent. Of truth he had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him that Command, but it had been with a deſign to keep him at Sea, far from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and from attempting to get here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by fair means, from <hi>Roxana,</hi> what he believ'd meer Fortune had thrown into his Arms; for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe Frowns of Fortune on his amorours deſigns, he doubted not but to ſucceed in time, and to obtain from <hi>Roxana</hi> now, what ſhe ſo poſitively refus'd him before, being of Opinion that

                  <p>The <hi>Mufti</hi> did make ſtrict inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Health, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers offers to viſit her, but all to no purpoſe; he addreſs'd himſelf to the Mother, who receiv'd him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Civilly, and did expreſs ſo much ſatisfaction in his Converſation, that he continu'd his Viſits to her, not without hopes to make her in time an Inſtrument for his acceſs to his beloved <hi>Roxana.</hi> He was not long without ſolliciting the Mother on that account, but ſtill ſhe wav'd the Diſcourſe, and put it off, not without being offended in her ſelf, at the ſlight the <hi>Mufti</hi> made of her Company, in ſo earneſtly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for her Daughter, while ſhe believed her ſelf more ſuitable in Age for his grave converſation,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62018:120"/>than <hi>Roxana</hi> was. But the <hi>Mufti</hi> at laſt growing quite weary of the Mother's company, which made him to ſlacken his Viſits, ſhe was oblig'd to make him a Promiſe, that ſhe would ſpeak to <hi>Roxana</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, to keep him ſtill to her. That made him to repeat his Viſits more frequently again, but ſtill more to ſolicite and preſs the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obtain leave of her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he might ſee her, than for any diverſion which he could pleaſe himſelf with, in the Mothers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; however he appear'd as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant towards her as he could force himſelf to repreſent, and he did ſo preſs the Mother to the performance of her promiſe, that ſhe was at laſt forc'd to ſpeak to <hi>Roxana</hi> about it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> did not only receive with all the coldneſs imaginable what ſhe ſaid, but took upon her to reprimand her Mother for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging her ſelf in ſo fowl a buſineſs,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62018:121"/>declaring once for all, that if ſhe would not let her be quiet at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> where ſhe remained meerly in complaiſance to her, and without any the leaſt inclination of her own, ſhe would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately write to her Father, to ſend for her into the Country. This anſwer made the Mother mute for ever after in the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s concerns, and rather than to be mew'd up again as ſhe had formerly been, in the Country, (which ſhe fear'd would happen but too ſoon,) ſhe reſolv'd to loſe one Courtier, in the perſon of the <hi>Mufti,</hi> to preſerve all the reſt that addreſs'd themſelves to her. She therefore told the <hi>Mufti;</hi> that ſhe had us'd all her endeavours to perſwade her Daughter, but all to no purpoſe, ſhe being ſo wedded to her deep Melancholy of late, that ſhe abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all manner of Converſation. This made our <hi>Mufti</hi> to withdraw himſelf in a ſhort time after from
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62018:121"/>the Mother's Coverſation alſo, though not to deſiſt from his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous purſuit of <hi>Roxana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Great rejoycings were at Court for the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s pregnancy, <hi>Cha-Abas</hi> fail'd not to ſend an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador to Congratulate the Emperor and <hi>Sultana</hi> about it. And at laſt the time came of the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thoſe news redoubled the joys of the <hi>Haliſts,</hi> inſomuch, that they no longer doubted of a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to the Empire, that ſhould be of their Sect, and that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently would preſerve that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the Empire. Mean time the true <hi>Mahometiſts,</hi> who were all diſgraciated, and laid aſide from all Offices of Truſt, and publick Employes, were very diligent in their enquiry into things, and they had a very great progreſs in the diſcovery of <hi>Cha-Abas</hi>'s deſigns, but they thought it not time yet to ſhew the leaſt ſign of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; that did ſo perſwade the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:62018:122"/>that they were poſſeſt with a Spirit of ſtupidity, and that they were wholly depriv'd of all Senſe and foreſight of their Miſery at hand, that they ſet the leſs guard on their Actions, and acted ſo viſibly their wicked Deſigns, that they became obvious to the very Vulgar Eyes. But amongſt all thoſe rejoycings, care was taken to diſtance from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> all ſuch Perſons as were to be concern'd in prying more narrowly into the Birth of the Pretended Child, than were conſiſtent with the <hi>Haliſts</hi> Deſigns. Wherefore ſome were confin'd to their Country Houſes; ſome few, who had yet ſome Governments of Provinces, were charg'd not to ſtir from thence without ſpecial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Emperor; others were ſent in Embaſſy. <hi>Amurat</hi>'s youngeſt Daughter was ſent by the forc'd Advice of her Phyſicians, to ſome Baths of warm Waters, at a great diſtance from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:62018:122"/>in order to recover that health, of which ſhe found no want. In fine, all but the <hi>Mufties</hi> of the true <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religon, were diſpers'd far enough from offering to prye into the grand Secrets of the Court. But thoſe <hi>Mufties</hi> were to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of alſo: Our <hi>Mufti</hi> was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd particularly in that work, he invented a <hi>Paper,</hi> which he caus'd <hi>Amurat</hi> to proclaim, was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhould be read in all the <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quées</hi> in his Dominions, which was ſo much againſt the formal Laws of the Empire, and of ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequences to the true <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, that the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> unanimouſly declin'd the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, in their reſpective <hi>Moſquées,</hi> only ſome few that were Temporiſers, did ſacrifice to their Intereſt and Ambition, the true Dictates of their own Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>This was ſufficient matter to bring thoſe refuſing <hi>Mufties</hi> into Examination, they were examin'd
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62018:123"/>before <hi>Amurat,</hi> and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all that they did alledge of juſt and honeſt, in vindication of their Innocence from the aſperſion of Diſobedience, and Rebellion, with which they were charg'd, they were all ſent Priſoners to the <hi>Tower</hi> of the <hi>Dardanelles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As this Confinement of the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> did highly rejoice the <hi>Haliſts,</hi> which did all conclude from thence, a ſudden fall of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to the Elevation of theirs, ſo it did raiſe ſuch fears and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions in the true <hi>Mahometiſts,</hi> that they began to provide with more vigour than ever, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand, againſt the Fatal ſtroke, which was ready to fall upon their Religion, Rights, and Lives. They ſent Meſſengers to Prince <hi>Solyman,</hi> to intreat him to be in a readineſs to defend his own Right, and the Laws of the Empire. He hearken'd to their advices, and made Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations underhand to aſſiſt thoſe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62018:123"/>of his own Religion, and to free them from <hi>Perſian</hi> ſlavery. Thus were all Parties buſie in ſupporting and promoting their own intereſt, by all means imaginable. The one pufft up with great hopes, and the other as much abaſed with fears and apprehenſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> was not without a very great increaſe of trouble on her part, notwithſtanding the general rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of all thoſe of her own Sect. She had felt ſome motions in her Belly, which ſhe was not accuſtom'd to feel, which with ſome ſick fits, that had lately come upon her, had made her to give her Mother an account of the whole; her Mother did preſently Judge by what her Daughter had told her, and by ſome other Circumſtances and Signs, that <hi>Roxana</hi> had not only been raviſh'd, but that ſhe had been got with Child alſo; She confirm'd her Daughter in thoſe Suſpicions that ſhe had of it, and the knowledge
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62018:124"/>of that further miſchief did whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt down <hi>Roxana,</hi> ſo that from that time ſhe confin'd her ſelf entirely to her Chamber, and would not admit but one from amongſt all her Servants, in which ſhe moſt confided, to approach near her, or to ſee her.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Mufti</hi> was not ſatisfied with applauding himſelf, with his late invention, wherewith he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapp'd his great Enemies, the <hi>Mufties</hi> of the true <hi>Mahometan</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (as he deem'd them) but he would be prais'd for it likewiſe by all his Party, not ſparing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat</hi> and the <hi>Sultana</hi> from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his Subtilty in the managing of that branch of the great work. To this purpoſe he went to pay his <hi>devoirs</hi> to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who he had not ſeen ſince that great Exploit: She fail'd not to magnifie his ingenuity, and to praiſe his indefatigable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in the propagation of the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62018:124"/>Faith: after which falling on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſcourſes, the <hi>Sultana</hi> ask'd him what was become of <hi>Roxana</hi> and her Mother? ſaying that ſhe had not ſeen them, nor heard of them ſince her return, and that ſhe had expected a congratulatory viſit from them for her great bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The <hi>Mufti</hi> glad that the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> had fallen on that Theam of her ſelf, made anſwer, that he had heard by accident, that they were ſtill both in Town, but that his multiplicity of buſineſs had hindred him from making any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiry about them. The <hi>Sultana</hi> ſaid that ſhe had a deſire to ſee the Beauteous, and Ingenious <hi>Roxana</hi> again; and with that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that a Meſſenger ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent from her, to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Daughter, to command them to wait on her that very day.</p>
                  <p>The Meſſenger deliver'd the Meſſage to <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Mother, but did not come to the ſpeech of her;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62018:125"/>and all that her Mother could ſay or do, after the Meſſenger was gone (to whom ſhe had ſaid, they both would obey the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging Commands) ſhe could not prevail with her to keep her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. <hi>What will the</hi> Sultana <hi>think,</hi> ſaid the Mother? <hi>What ſhall I ſay? What excuſe ſhall I make?</hi> All that <hi>Roxana</hi> ſaid, was, <hi>what you pleaſe, uſe your own diſcretion, and act according to your own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> The Mother was forc'd to go to the Seraglio without <hi>Roxana,</hi> very much diſſatisfied, and very full of thoughts, what ſhe ſhould tell the <hi>Sultana,</hi> and whether ſhe had beſt to diſcover to her what misfortunes had hapned to <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> or not: She left all to the conduct of Fortune, and reſolv'd to diſcover, or keep ſecret accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the <hi>Sultana</hi> would give her occaſion to act. She was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiv'd by the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who preſently ask'd after <hi>Roxana. Is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62018:125"/>ſhe ſick,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Sultana? Yes, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Mother; <hi>ſhe is not well, nor very ſick neither. What Riddle is this,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Sultana? Pray unfold it.</hi> At this, the Mother, who had much to do to retain her Tears, and in whoſe Face the <hi>Sultana</hi> had obſerv'd great marks of Sorrow, could no longer contain her ſelf: She gave her Eyes liberty to diſchage themſelves upon her Cheeks, which ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly mov'd the <hi>Sultana,</hi> that ſhe once again bid her to let her know what was the cauſe of ſo great a Sorrow as ſhe expreſs'd? aſſuring her, that nothing ſhould be wanting to give her comfort. <hi>My Griefs are of that nature, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> reply'd the Mother, <hi>that they will not admit of any Redreſs. I muſt reſt ſatisfy'd in letting you know them, without any hopes of Comfort, neither from you, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body elſe in the World, continu'd ſhe. But, Madam, ſince it is your
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62018:126"/>pleaſure to hear my ſorowful Story, be pleas'd, at leaſt, to afford me your Pity.</hi> With that ſhe told the <hi>Sultana</hi> all that had happen'd to <hi>Roxana,</hi> ſince the Court's remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val and return. <hi>This is very ill for poor</hi> Roxana, ſaid the <hi>Sultana, the rather, becauſe that there is no means left to know her Raviſher, who, though I do not believe to be deſignedly ſo, yet deſerv'd ſome pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for uſing ſo ill the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which he had of ſerving poor</hi> Roxana <hi>in a nobler way; at leaſt, if he were a perſon ſutable to her rank, he ſhould be compell'd to marry her, or I ſhould loſe my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with</hi> Amurat. <hi>But though I cannot redreſs your Griefs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my own deſires, in ſome meaſure I will alleviate them, and render them ſomewhat more eaſie for you both to bear. Does any body know of</hi> Roxana<hi>'s misfortune,</hi> added the <hi>Sultana? No, Madam, not any one, I can aſſure you; for
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62018:126"/>ſhe has not ſeen the Face of any perſon ſince; nor could I ſo much as prevail with her to wait upon you, Madam: I cannot deny, but that Zora,</hi> Mufti Repſet<hi>'s Siſter, may ſuſpect ſomething of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as having had a hand in it on the</hi> Mufti<hi>'s account, ſo far as his deſign went. That's nothing,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Sultana: They are both of the Cabal, in which I now will joyn you and</hi> Roxana, <hi>as being perſons that may be of great uſe to me in carrying on the great deſign. But you muſt be all ſecret, not a whiſper, or a betraying look, or all is loſt. Madam, you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our Lives,</hi> reply'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>we ſhould go to our deaths without murmuring, if it were to ſerve you. I believe you, and thank you,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Sultana. Know now, that for the good of our Cauſe, and the Glory of the Sect of our great Prophet</hi> Haly, <hi>it has been thought fit by our Privy
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62018:127"/>Council, that I ſhould feign to be with Child; and it has been ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out already, to be about that very time in which</hi> Roxana <hi>was made ſo in effect. There are ſome Women that have prov'd pregnant about that time alſo, who have Spies upon them, to obſerve whether they will have a Boy at the time of their delivery, that I may be ſupply'd with a Male Child, when my feigned time of deliverance is accompliſh'd: now if</hi> Roxana<hi>'s Child proves to be a Son, nothing would be more conformable to my deſires, than to have it to paſs for a Prince. Tell</hi> Roxana <hi>this from me, that ſhe ſhould continue in her ſolitary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs ſtill on this account, and that when the buſineſs is over, I ſhall take care to provide for her according to her quality and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; mean time,</hi> continu'd ſhe, <hi>give her this from me, with an aſſurance of my ſpecial favour:</hi> With that, ſhe gave her a rich
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62018:127"/>Jewel, and ſo diſmiſs'd her.</p>
                  <p>The Mother being return'd home, told all the whole Story to <hi>Roxana,</hi> who being ſtill more and more afflicted at the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her misfortune, did not rejoyce, as her Mother expected, at the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s confidence which ſhe repos'd in them, nor at her kind aſſurances of favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; on the contrary, ſhe plung'd her ſelf deeper ſtill in Melancholy; ſo that from that time ſhe continu'd in darkneſs, admitting of no more light into her Chamber, than what a ſmall dim Taper did afford.</p>
                  <p>The Confinement of the <hi>Mufties</hi> in the Tower of the <hi>Dardanelles,</hi> had much diſturb'd the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the true <hi>Mahometiſts;</hi> they had murmur'd aloud, they had acted with more fire than uſually, ſo that it was known that they did expect ſome aſſiſtance from ſome place, but whence not yet
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62018:128"/>certainly known; and buſineſs not being ripe to come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, on the <hi>Haliſts</hi> party, till the pretended Heir were come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, to ſatisfie the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude as well as others, and keep them under, till their riſing would be to no effect, a day was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for bringing the impriſon'd <hi>Mufties</hi> to a publick Examination, to ſatisfie the true <hi>Mahometiſts,</hi> but it was ſo deferr'd, that it ſhould not be till after the <hi>Sultana</hi> had been deliver'd of her fictitious great Belly.</p>
                  <p>The time of her delivery at laſt grew near, according to that reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which they had given out, but becauſe it did not exactly agree with the true reckoning which <hi>Roxana</hi> made, or that her Mother made for her, (for ſhe her ſelf minded nothing) another Reckning was ſet up, and given out, and that being near out alſo, the <hi>Sultana</hi> had ordered at what places ſhe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62018:128"/>would Lye In, which were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in one place, ſometimes in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; that no body ſhould have any certain knowledge of it, but thoſe who were of the Secret.</p>
                  <p>It was not long after, that <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Mother ſent a Letter to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> to let her know that her Daughter was in her effectual La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; Orders were preſently ſent back in a Letter, <hi>that ſhe ſhould be brought into the</hi> Seraglio, <hi>if it were poſſible to be done with Secreſie.</hi> But ſhe was ſo far gone, that it could not be; and ſhe being deliver'd of a Son, the Child, according to the orders that had been given, was ſecretly convey'd to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> into that Appartment which the <hi>Sultana</hi> had laſt made choice of, there kept by a good Fire in the next Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to that appointed for the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>'s Lying In, and notice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently brought to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> that every thing was in a readineſs. The <hi>Sultana</hi> did preſently get her ſelf
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62018:129"/>carried to that Apartment by ſome of her Attendants, and put into her Bed, the Midwife and all the reſt of the Confederacy at hand. <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> had notice given that the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> was in Labour, and he ſent to his late Brother's <hi>Sultana,</hi> and to divers others of the Sect of <hi>Hali,</hi> inſtantly to repair to that Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which the <hi>Sultana</hi> had been newly tranſported, there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently was a conſiderable appearance at the appointed place, of ſuch as were of the Sect of <hi>Hali,</hi> except two or three at the moſt of old true <hi>Mahometiſts,</hi> who being held in Diſcourſe by <hi>Amurat</hi> at the Beds feet, the Curtains being ſhut cloſe round the Bed, ſo that nothing was to be ſeen, and ſcarce heard, for the <hi>Sultana</hi> not being accuſtomed to thoſe ſorts of Pageantry, ſhe could not bring her ſelf to cry out with that vigour and ſtrength that acute Pains cauſe Women to do; but however the Child being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed

                  <p>The News of a new born Prince being ſpread abroad, it afforded new Subject of great Joy, to all
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62018:130"/>thoſe of the Sect of <hi>Hali;</hi> amongſt the reſt of their demonſtrations of joy, there was a Fire-work, which was ſo great, and ſo curiouſly contriv'd, that it ſeem'd as if thoſe Fuſees of which it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, were flying up, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to conſume the Region of Fire, to burſt in pieces the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts, to fire Lightning, and to allarm the very Stars. Preſently were ſeen Ambaſſadours from all parts, amongſt which, one from <hi>Cha-Abas</hi> was not the laſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment the Emperour and <hi>Sultana</hi> on the birth of the young Prince.</p>
                  <p>But now that ſo much of the great work was done; that which remained yet undone, was to be thought of. <hi>Roxana</hi> remain'd ſtill unconſolable, inſomuch that ſhe never made any enquiry after her Child, whether it was dead or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; neither did ſhe take ſuch care of her ſelf as ſhe ought to do; but that was her Mother's
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62018:130"/>part, of which ſhe acquitted her ſelf as ſhe ought to do. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet Council thought fit to have <hi>Roxana</hi> convey'd out of the way, leſt that, having been made privy to the Plot, at ſome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe ſhould in one of her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick fits diſcover the whole miſtery: and the <hi>Mufti Repſet</hi> was appointed to perform that pious piece of work. He undertook the buſineſs, but it was not till after he had attempted and try'd all the ways and means imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reclaim <hi>Roxana</hi> out of her deep melancholy, and to bring her to give an ear to his addreſſes; but finding all to be labour in vain, he on the ſudden converted all his former Love into Hatred; inſomuch that he did not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive her Confinement in ſome place in <hi>Perſia,</hi> but he charg'd thoſe who were appointed to guard her, and convey her to the Galley that ſhould tranſport her, with
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62018:131"/>Letters which contain'd, that <hi>that Perſon ſhould be receiv'd,</hi> meaning <hi>Roxana, into the Order to which ſhe was directed; and that after ſhe had been brought by hardſhip to a ſevere penance, ſhe ſhould be ſent into another World by the means of ſome gentle Poiſon.</hi> And that the <hi>Mufti</hi> ſhould not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the leaſt in his revenge, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected her to be privately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd into that Galley which was commanded by <hi>Cara;</hi> that he whom he believ'd to be <hi>Roxana</hi>'s innocent Raviſher, ſhould have a hand in her death. Thus <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was ſent away <hi>incognito,</hi> to her own ruine, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of change of Air, for her health ſake.</p>
                  <p>All this while <hi>Aladin</hi> had been kept in ignorance of all that had paſs'd at his Houſe in <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and as oft as he had ſent for leave of the Emperour to come up to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he ſtill had
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62018:131"/>been deny'd by our <hi>Mufti</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances: but ſo ſoon as <hi>Roxana</hi> was ſent away, he had liberty ſent him to come to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sultana</hi> having accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had ſome intelligence of our <hi>Mufti</hi>'s cruelty againſt poor <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> to whom ſhe had promis'd her protection, gave private notice to <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Mother, that there was a Letter ſent with her, which was to be deliver'd to the Captain of the Galley, which he was not to open, but to deliver it as it was to thoſe perſons to whom he was to deliver <hi>Roxana;</hi> which Letter contain'd orders for <hi>Roxana</hi>'s death. And ſhe advis'd the Mother to ſend immediately an expreſs after <hi>Roxana,</hi> to give her private notice thereof in writing. The Mother loſt no time, and the Meſſenger came juſt as <hi>Roxana</hi> was getting into the Galley. <hi>Cara</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd his order, and, by the reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62018:132"/>believing his Charge to be ſome perſon of quality, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to remain conceal'd, he ſhew'd her to the beſt Cabbin, without any further inquiry who this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be; and of truth, there was no body there that could inform him: for at <hi>Roxana</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> all her own Servants had been diſcharg'd, and new ones, which ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen before, were appointed to wait on her that Journey.</p>
                  <p>Thus was poor, unfortunate <hi>Roxana</hi> doom'd to death, and ſent to it by him who had been the chief cauſe of her greateſt ſorrow. But the Heavens, who permit ſometimes Wickedneſs to triumph over Innocence and Virtue for a while, will not reſt till they have brought the Wicked to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not permitting Goodneſs to be always oppreſs'd, as we ſhall ſee in the continuation of <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Story.</p>

                  <p>The great rejoycing which the <hi>Haliſts</hi> made for their young Heir to the Empire, did but the more incenſe thoſe of the true <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Religion, who were highly diſturb'd already at the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their <hi>Mufties,</hi> and they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd openly at it, which caus'd that the <hi>Haliſts,</hi> who had now no further occaſion for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, at leaſt for the preſent, did releaſe them, after a kind of Examination, which was more for Form, than any thing that could with Juſtice be alledg'd againſt them. But more Severity than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was us'd againſt all true <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometiſts;</hi> and the <hi>Haliſts</hi> were ſo full of the deſigns which they had of ſuddenly deſtroying them, that they could not forbear their open threatnings. Of truth, it was diſcover'd that there was an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made betwixt <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and <hi>Cha-Abas</hi> to deſtroy all ſuch as would not become <hi>Haliſts;</hi>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:62018:133"/>and to that purpoſe, <hi>Cha-Abas</hi> was to ſend a <hi>Perſian</hi> Army into the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, which was to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the <hi>Haliſts</hi> in their wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, to totally root out the True, Ancient <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to deſtroy all the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof with Fire and Sword, and to clear the whole Empire of that Religion</p>
                  <p>The Blow was ready to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when that all the Nobility of the Ancient and True Religion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> made an aſſociation amongſt themſelves, to ſtand and fall one by another, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their Religion, and the preſervation of the fundamental Laws of the Empire. This they ſigned, and ſent over to Prince <hi>Soliman,</hi> by a particular Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with Letters to humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him to defer no longer his coming to redeem them from Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Idolatry; that now the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sword was ready to fall
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62018:133"/>upon their Heads, and that if he ſtay'd any longer from giving them aſſiſtance, that in their ruine he would meet with an end to all his juſt pretenſions to the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Soliman,</hi> who had had ſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences from all hands of <hi>Cha-Abas</hi> deſigns, that knew that he would no ſooner have done with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, but that he would be for diveſting of him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, of his Dominions, did preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly march at the head of a great Army, into the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; where being come, and not finding the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s to joyn with him, as they had aſſur'd him they would do, he was thinking of retiring again, knowing well, that how great ſoever his Army was, it was very inſufficient to oppoſe <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Forces, ſo long as they remain'd united; but he was not long in that ſuſpenſe, for ſo ſoon as the Nobles had conveniences,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62018:134"/>they all came over with their men to him, who being ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reinforc'd, and <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Army ſo weaken'd, or rather entirely rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he march'd ſtreight-way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> without the leaſt conſiderable reſiſtance, all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces yielding to him as he march'd.</p>
                  <p>This ſudden and unexpected Change in the <hi>Haliſts</hi> Affairs, did ſo ſurpriſe them, that every one of them began to ſhift for themſelves, amongſt which, the Prieſts of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry order of <hi>Hali</hi>'s Sect, were not the laſt. <hi>Amurat</hi> himſelf, ſeeing what a prodigious Change had happen'd in all his Dominions, thought it neceſſary to ſend ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly away, the <hi>Sultana</hi> with the Child, into <hi>Cha-Abas</hi>'s Dominions, and he himſelf, did not long after, follow them, reſolv'd to deprive himſelf of the Empire for the good of his Subjects, ſeeing that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Government did not ſute with his Religion.</p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:62018:134"/>
                  <p>It is now time we ſhould return to poor unfortunate <hi>Roxana.</hi> At her reception into the <hi>Galley,</hi> through her diſorder in getting in, her Vail had fallen ſo much aſide, as to give <hi>Cara</hi> a ſufficient view, to let him know what a Beautiful Perſon he was intruſted withal. But <hi>Roxana</hi> was ſo alter'd from her former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by her inceſſant grief that perſons who had more and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er opportunities of ſeeing her, than <hi>Cara,</hi> would not have known her again; beſides, he was far from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining, that ſhe, who had liv'd all along ſo retiredly, ſhould be for going into <hi>Perſia.</hi> He had then as much ſight of her, as was ſufficient to ſet his heart all on fire, and to create in him an extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſeeing more openly that Beauty, and of inquiring who ſhe was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi>'s thoughts were taken up another way, ſhe ſitting alone in her <hi>Cabin,</hi> had time to run over
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62018:135"/>all her Misfortunes, and to deſcant upon every particular Circumſtance of them. But that which troubled her moſt in that juncture, was the advice which her Mother had ſent her in Writing, concerning the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which had been delivered with her into the Captain's hand, in which was written the Sentence of her Death; but no Advice or Counſel had been added to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Care, how ſhe ſhould avoid or get off that danger. <hi>Cara</hi>'s Love would not let him reſt, he took all occaſions, and made uſe of all the opportunities that offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to ſhew a more than uſual Zeal and Diligence, to ſerve her perſonally, thereby both to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother fair ſight of her, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate himſelf into her good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; of truth, he was ſo diligent in ſerving her, beyond that moroſe way which moſt of thoſe, who uſe the Seas, are inclin'd to, that <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> could not but obſerve it; and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62018:135"/>thoſe aſſiduous Services being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with divers Preſents of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, and offers of further Services, <hi>Roxana</hi> had no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place to doubt, but that all was the Effects of her unfortunate beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as ſhe us'd to ſtile it.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Opinion, ſhe began to build ſome hopes to attain to the knowledge of the Particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the fatal Letter, whereby ſhe hop'd that ſhe might find out ſome means to prevent that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which ſhe was going to. To this purpoſe, ſhe thought that her Beauty, though ſo much alter'd of late, might much contribute eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards a perſon, who ſhe perceiv'd did endeavour by all means imaginable, to ſee her face wholly unvail'd, ſhe therefore was not long without giving him an opportunity of ſo doing, but ſo as if it were by meer accident. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the want of a free Air in the Cabin, did make her ſick,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62018:136"/>and therefore deſired <hi>Cara</hi> that he would give his Priſoner leave, (as ſhe term'd her ſelf) to take a little Air upon the Deck. That was a Requeſt ſo ſuitable to <hi>Cara</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that he made her this anſwer. <hi>My Priſoner, Madam, ſaid you? I know of no ſuch thing; and if you were ſo really, you have thoſe Charms about you that will ſet you free, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you deſire them to act; be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, Madam,</hi> continued he, <hi>that I am ſo far from thinking you a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, much leſs of uſing you like one, that I here offer you all my Services, in any thing that may tend to your ſatisfaction and content; with that he took her by the hand, and led her upon the moſt convenient place on the Deck.</hi> Where ſhe ſate un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 chunk">

                  <p>The Wind blowing a little freſh, her Vail was diſordered by it, ſhe took that opportunity of ſhewing
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:62018:136"/>her ſelf, in pulling it quite off, as ſhe was about ſetting of it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again, as if by accident; which cauſing her to bluſh, ſhe ſaid to <hi>Cara,</hi> who ſtood as if ſtruck with Thunder at the admiration of ſo much beauty, <hi>The very Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſet againſt me, they would not elſe have diſcovered to you, Sir, that which may hereafter ſlacken your Civilities towards a Perſon, that now you will have no longer any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that ſhe deſerves them.

Take heed, Sir, that you ſay,</hi> replyed <hi>Roxana, you
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:62018:137"/>know not to whom you make thoſe fair offers, and what great inducements I may have to take you at your word! You may wonder, and not without cauſe, at my forwardneſs, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of your Services,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>but know, Sir, that thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that I at preſent lye under, may be of ſuch a nature as may plead my excuſe, for a way of proceeding ſo contrary to the Rules that the moſt prudent and modeſt of our Sex do obſerve. In a word, Sir, I find that I have not too much time left me, to imploy after ſome means, to preſerve my life. Once more, Sir, I tell you that I am your Priſoner, and that you have orders to lead me and to deliver me up to my Executioners. Who I, Madam,</hi> replyed Cara, ſtrangely ſurpris'd, <hi>when did I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch Orders? and from whom? From</hi> Mufti Repſet, replyed <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.

Yes, Sir, I know that you have a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which is contain'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of my Death, and that in the delivery or retention of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, conſiſts either my happineſs or miſery. I muſt confeſs, Madam, that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:62018:138"/>I have a Letter, <hi>anſwer'd Cara,</hi> which I have order to deliver with you into ſuch perſons hands as I have mentioned, but what the Contents are, I am wholly ignorant of; only this intimation I have had from the <hi>Mufti</hi> you mention'd, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Emperor's particular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that therefore I ſhould be very obſervant in the delivery of it. Well, Sir, <hi>replyed Roxana,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Order, and deliver me up a Victim to the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s revenge, though you incur the Emperor's diſpleaſure, Who, I am certain, knows nothing of it.

                     <hi>Roxana!</hi> Oh Heav'ns! what turn of Fortune is this? I ſerve the <hi>Mufti</hi> in ſo foul a deed, (for it muſt needs be true, ſince <hi>Roxana</hi> has ſaid it) I ſerve the <hi>Mufti?</hi> nay <hi>Amurat</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, againſt <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Life? May all the Elements contrive my imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ruine firſt, and inſtantly bring it upon me. No, Divine <hi>Roxana, continu'd he, caſting himſelf at her feet,</hi> Rather than be acceſſary in any thing that can cauſe the leaſt trouble to you; nay, rather than not return the Heavens thanks, for having thought me worthy of ſo great an Honour, as to be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the preſerving of that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Creature from all manner of Evil, let my Veſſel ſplit, and I be ſwallowed up immediately into the deep, never to be ſeen more, ſo <hi>Roxana</hi> be but ſafe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe paſſionate Expreſſions, with her Name ſo frequently repeated, made <hi>Roxana</hi> to believe that ſhe was known to <hi>Cara,</hi> though ſhe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:62018:139"/>could not remember that ſhe had ever ſeen him; it made her put a ſtop to her Tears, and lifting up her Eyes, to ſee whether ſhe could call to mind any remembrance of him. You ſpeak, Sir, as if you knew me, at leaſt my Name, <hi>ſaid Roxana,</hi> and as if you were concern'd more than ordinarily at my miſery. Nay, you ſeem to believe that the <hi>Mufti</hi> is my Enemy? Your Enemy, Madam, <hi>replyed Cara,</hi> the blackeſt of them, and more, that he is the only prime cauſe of all your troubles, though peradventure ſome perſon more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and at once more unhappy than he, by meer hazard, may have been thrown upon the proſecution of his Helliſh deſigns againſt ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a perſon as <hi>Roxana</hi> is, where he himſelf had fallen ſhort of them. At theſe words, <hi>Cara</hi> chang'd Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, look'd on the Floor, and ſeem'd ſo diſcompos'd, that <hi>Roxana</hi> was ſeis'd with ſuch ſtrange Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions at it, as made her to deſire to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62018:140"/>be in private, under pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly taken ill. That was ſo conformable to the condition that <hi>Cara</hi> was in on his part, that he went out of the Cabin, without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one word more, nor ſo much as looking towards <hi>Roxana,</hi> who had turn'd likewiſe aſide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> being thus alone, began to reflect on what <hi>Cara</hi> had ſaid: ſhe wondred that a Perſon ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown to her, ſhould have ſo much knowledge of her moſt ſecret Concerns, as he ſeem'd to have, ſhe not doubting, but that he knew all, by what he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid; ſhe believ'd that he was not ignorant of her Rape, and fancied that peradventure he might know the Perſon that had done it. This made her to deſire to know more, but ſhe had not the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to require it: She wiſh'd that <hi>Cara</hi> would of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord fall accidentally on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject again, yet ſhe dreaded to hear
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:62018:140"/>any more. In fine, ſhe was in ſuch a perplexity of thoughts, that they had almoſt driven from her all the apprehenſions which ſhe ſhould have had of her approaching dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cara,</hi> on his part was not leſs ſurpriz'd; he had under his care that beautiful Perſon, which meer Fortune had thrown into his Arms, at the ſame time that the <hi>Mufti</hi> had contriv'd things ſo as to make her his own. He believ'd that the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> had miſtruſted that he was the Perſon who had diſappointed him, or taken his place; and he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that his procuring of him ſuch an Employ as he had, was but to diſtance him from <hi>Roxana,</hi> that he might not have the opportunity of making his peace with her, when ſhe ſhould know that he had enjoy'd her, when he had no thoughts of her, but was wholly bent on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And finally, he believ'd, that in pure rage and revenge he had
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62018:141"/>done her ſome very ill office to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Emperour, which had made him conſent to her death. Theſe, and divers other thoughts did agitate him moſt violently: there wanted nothing more to confirm him in the belief of all thoſe things but her acknowledging of the Ring he had taken from that Perſon whom he had enjoyed, but he had not the confidence to give or ſhew it to her: at laſt, he reſolv'd to ſet down in writing what he would willingly have her to know, and to give it with the Ring wrapt up in it, to one of <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Servants, to deliver it to <hi>Roxana:</hi> whereupon having taken Pen and Ink, he fram'd this following long Letter, that it might fully ſupply all that he had to ſay, which he could never utter before <hi>Roxana</hi>'s preſence.</p>

But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I was innocent all this while; witneſs the ſtrange ſurprizal I was in, to find that I had gather'd ſuch Fruit as none had ever touch'd before, at that time, that all my thoughts were bent only on <hi>Zora,</hi> who that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night had made me an aſſignation in that Chamber where I met with you, Madam, and from whom I was far from expecting ſuch Virgin Fruit, whoſe Life and Converſation I knew but too well. How ſhe came not to be in that Chamber, and how I came to light on you there, does ſtill remain a Riddle to me. I muſt confeſs, that at the reſiſtance you would have made, and which you endeavour'd to make, as much as the narcotick effects of your Opium would permit, I found my miſtake; but who could then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain and retire? No Fleſh and Blood, Madam: I accepted of what For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had thus thrown into my arms; and becauſe I was abſolutely ignorant
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:62018:142"/>of the Perſon I had met with, I took from her Finger the Ring which I have ſent you. If any thing in all this adventure can be laid to my charge, which might render me guilty in the leaſt circumſtance imaginable towards you, I will doom my ſelf immediately to death; nay, what is worſe, I will deprive my ſelf from the happineſs of ever ſeeing you more, and yet live. But, Madam, if nothing but meer hazard and Fortune had the conduct of all that myſtery, let me not for what is none of my fault, ſuffer the greateſt of evils, your Frowns and Anger. The Heavens, in reſcuing you from the embraces of ſo wicked a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as he, who had plotted the ruine of your Honour, did reſign you into mine; and they thought me once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthy of being your Deliverer. The ſame Heaven, Madam, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards take you from the <hi>Mufti,</hi> to give you to me; and they have given me a Heart that is capable-of all things that are Noble and Juſt, and which
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62018:143"/>may be valu'd on the very account of aſpiring to the Honour of pleaſing you. Though my Fortune is not great, my Extraction is Noble: deign therefore, beautiful <hi>Roxana,</hi> to look down a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon a Perſon that the Fates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd you from the beginning, that was produc'd for you, and that they have given you already: for who can look upon our unexpected, unſought, and unthought of encounter, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it is the will of Heaven that we ſhould be united? Is not this laſt act of your blackeſt Enemy, the greateſt argument imaginable, that when he deſign'd moſt your Ruine, I ſhould be choſen for the moſt happy Inſtrument of your deliverance, by the Heavens, as I had been once before of your deliverance from his filthy embraces? How can you then doubt, but that I was certainly deſign'd for you, as you have been for me. Reſiſt not then againſt what the Heavens have decreed, but accept of an heart, which is ſo freely offer'd you.</p>

                     <hi>Cara</hi> found that he could dwell for ever on this Theam, therefore he was forc'd to break off his Letter, which he gave to one of <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Servants, who went immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cabin, and preſented it to her. <hi>Roxana</hi> asked from whom it was, and ſhe was told from <hi>Cara,</hi> which ſet her all in a trembling, with the apprehenſion of learning that which ſhe ſo earneſtly deſired to know: She open'd it, and read it, and after that remain'd for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time agitated with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of contrary thoughts on the whole Myſtery of her deliverance, and afterwards of her raviſhment, by the ſame perſon; and having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly weighed all Circumſtances, and convinc'd her ſelf that <hi>Cara</hi> had not been in the leaſt to blame, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he had before-hand known who ſhe was, which he did not: She began to think, that of truth, the Heav'ns had deſign'd <hi>Cara</hi> for her, and ſhe for him.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:62018:144"/>therein, by that Providence which once appointed him to be her deliverer, and had delivered her into the hands of a perſon, that ſo paſſionately lov'd her, when ſhe was deſign'd to have been given by that very perſon to her Executioners. She therefore reſolv'd to comply to the Heav'ns Decrees, in receiving of <hi>Cara</hi>'s Service in the preſervation of her Life, which ſhould paſs as an Atonement for what he had done, and that ſhe would place on the account of Merit, for the future.

                     <hi>Cara</hi> having receiv'd this anſwer, was ſo over-joyed at it, that he preſently run into <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Cabbin, with the Letter open in his hand, after he had read it; and caſting himſelf at <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Feet, Here, Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> take this, take me, take all, and diſpoſe of me, of my Veſſel, and all my Men as you ſhall think ſit; all is at your Command. <hi>Roxana</hi> was reading attentively the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this while, after ſhe had done, raiſing him up, You ſee <hi>Cara, ſaid ſhe,</hi> by this Letter, that the Heavens have decreed I ſhould be yours; they would not elſe thus render me oblig'd to you for my Life; and ſince they have ſo order'd, that I muſt receive it as a Preſent from you, I think I ought in gratitude to return it again into your hands, and at your diſpoſal. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> replyed <hi>Cara, my Life is bound up in yours, ſo that I cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you; receive mine therefore, with all its habilities and functions, as abſolutely depending on yours; and accept of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſhall ever be your Slave and your Admirer.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:62018:145"/>him the Ring, <hi>receive this Pledge again, which I now freely give you, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that I give my ſelf to you alſo; and accept of this Weapon, which I preſent you, wherewith to defend me from all my Enemies,</hi> with that ſhe gave him that Scimiter which he had left in her Chamber at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> He preſently knew it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, receiv'd it, and ſaid, <hi>I hope, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, that henceforth I ſhall have no occaſion of uſing ſuch Arms in your defence; I ſhall free you from your trouble by eaſier means. The wicked</hi> Mufti<hi>'s Party is now ſo ruin'd, that the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Empire has ſpu'd him out, with divers more of his wicked Sect. Wicked indeed,</hi> replyed <hi>Roxana, ſo wicked, that I hate the very thoughts of that Sect, and would gladly embrace the True, Ancient,</hi> Mahometan <hi>Religion. You wanted nothing but that, Madam,</hi> replyed <hi>Cara, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh you as my heart could wiſh; and certainly it is the ſame kind Heavens who have preſerv'd your Life, that now takes care of your Soul alſo, in inſpiring you with ſo good thoughts; oppoſe them not, but yield immediately to this Call from Heaven; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from amongſt a People that are pleas'd but with Deceits and Cruelties, and come amongſt ſuch as delight to ſerve their God in Spirit and Truth.

In ſhort, they had a better Wind in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than they had going, which quickly brought them back to the Shore, from whence they came to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Prince was made ſenſible of the wrong which was intended to him by the <hi>Haliſts.</hi> The whole Empire thought themſelves oblig'd to <hi>Soliman,</hi> in ſo high a meaſure, that in the great Aſſembly of the <hi>Divan,</hi> he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd Emperour, and <hi>Zelinda</hi> Empreſs, that very day after ſhe came to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>NO ſooner had that Piece call'd, <hi>The Amours of Meſſalina,</hi> appear'd in Publick, but ſome mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſons gave out, that I was the Author of it, they having heard under-hand, that I was about ſome ſuch thing; and though preſently after, there came forth another Piece on the ſame Subject in my Name, Entitled, <hi>The Court Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> in which Crown'd Heads are treated with that Reverence and Reſpect which is due to them: They have ſtill continu'd to miſrepreſent me to the World, adding, That the
<pb facs="tcp:62018:148"/>ſevere Rebukes which I had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for my rude Behaviour towards Sovereigns in the firſt, had made me to compoſe the laſt in another ſtrain, by way of Submiſſion. Did thoſe Perſons that thus aſperſe me but conſider with what Reſpect I ſpeak of Perſons that once have had Dominion over me, they would not find one grain of that ill Nature in all my Writings, with which the Amours of <hi>Meſſalina</hi> have been ſeaſon'd by its Author, as if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly writ as a Satyr againſt the late King and Queen, which has prov'd a Scandal to all moderate and modeſt Perſons.</p>
                  <p>There are Men in the World that reſemble ſome Creatures, which the Naturaliſts report to be of ſo venomous Natures, that ſuck Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from thoſe very Plants that other Animals gather Odoriferous Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſams and Honey, and that corrupt the very Air they take in; ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:62018:148"/>at the breathing of it forth again, it deſtroys all that approaches near them. Their natural ill Diſpoſitions and Inclinations have ſuch ſtrong Tendences to Evil, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert all the Advantages which they might have receiv'd from Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Learning, and good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, into ſcandalous Conceptions and Expreſſions, without reſpect to Dignities or Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Certainly thoſe Perſons muſt needs be void of that Charity, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a multitude of Defects, that thus delight to impoſe the worſt of Crimes on thoſe that have been their Lords and Sovereigns, unto whom all Honour and Reſpect is due, from thoſe who once were their Subjects, if it were but for the bare Relation they have to our preſent King and Queen, whom God long preſerve.</p>
                  <p>It may be alledged (though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingeniouſly) That I my ſelf am guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that which is blamed in others,
<pb facs="tcp:62018:149"/>by ſpeaking too largely of another King, under the Name of <hi>Cha-abas</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Perſia.</hi> But when all is done, that very Perſon intended, was never my King, and God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid he ever ſhould be ſo; and what do I ſay of him, nay, what can I ſay more of him, than what has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been declar'd and proclaim'd, not by a few of his own inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heretick Subjects (as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call thoſe that are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants) but alſo by the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Kings of <hi>England, Denmark, Sweden,</hi> the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and all the Confederate Princes, all which has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by his moſt Holy Father the Pope? Is he not publickly declar'd the common Enemy of Chriſtendom? Has he not with Juſtice acquired the Mock-title of moſt <hi>Chriſtian Turk,</hi> in lieu of that of moſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King?</hi> Has he not fomented the Diſorders in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
<pb facs="tcp:62018:149"/>the <hi>Turks</hi> to invade the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, promiſing them to give ſuch a diverſion to the Emperour's Arms another way, that they ſhould find a very eaſie Conqueſt of it? And has he not ſhew'd us greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Cruelties, than the very Infidels have done againſt poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians on the bare account of their Religion, in the barbarous Murthers of his own Subjects? Pillaging, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deſtroying all places that the Juſtice of his Enemies Arms force him to abandon, not ſo much as ſparing thoſe which are conſecrated to that God which he adores (if he owns any at all) and all this after the Murther of Men and Children, and the Raviſhing and Deflowering of the grave Matrons and Virgins? Nay, it rather may be ask'd, What has he not done of moſt cruel, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and inhumane? And when he was rather tired, than ſatiated, not contented with all thoſe Acts of
<pb facs="tcp:62018:150"/>Cruelty which he had committed both at home and abroad, in the profoundeſt Security that a Peace could procure, while he himſelf took breath; Has he not us'd his utmoſt Endeavours to delude a too eaſie Prince who he had charm'd with his Flatteries and deceitful Promiſes, and by the influence of his all-doing dazling Gold, to follow his ſleps, till truſting too much on his plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſurances, he has been depriv'd of the Love of his own People, of the Friendſhip of his Allies, and at laſt of his three Kingdoms alſo? And had we not by this time all of us been convinc'd of the ſad Effects of the <hi>French</hi> King's Advices and Counſels, by a moſt woful and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Experience, had not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Hand of God interpos'd.</p>
                  <p>If then that King has rendred himſelf ſo odious to all Chriſtians in becoming their profeſs'd and declar'd Enemy, through the Tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb facs="tcp:62018:150"/>of his own People, and his perfidious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations on his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as to draw upon himſelf ſuch harſh, though rightly deſerved Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, I may very well be excus'd, for what I have ſaid of the ſame Perſon, in a Novel, where Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolies are allowed in their largeſt extent: I having had no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in the whole Buſineſs than to gratifie the Reader with joyning the Pleaſant to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful, without the leaſt intention of railing, or ſo much as making any ſevere Reflexions, or bearing malice againſt any Perſon, even my profeſt Enemies, much leſs againſt ſuch as are abſolute Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to me.</p>

                  <head>The Court Secret: A NOVEL.</head>
                  <head type="sub">PART II.</head>
                  <p>AMbition is a Paſſion ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and imperious, that when a Mind is once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with it, there is rarely any admittance for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the ſame time: It ſeizes the whole Man, and Love it ſelf,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62018:153"/>that maſters the Maſters of the World, can ſcarce get entrance in an heart prepoſſeſs'd with that Tyrant, that is continually fed with thoſe Court-Flatteries where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Princes are uſually enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is no Rule ſo general, that will not admit of ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and in the Perſon of <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> the now Emperor of <hi>Perſia,</hi> may be ſeen that that unſufferable Ambition, which caus'd him to aim at an Univerſal Monarchy, and that has arm'd all the World againſt him, threatning no leſs than the utter Subverſion of his Empire, has at the ſame time receiv'd alſo into his Boſom that little Deity, who blinds all thoſe Victims which he deſigns for Sacrifices; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Vulgar, who ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom dive into the Secrets of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have attributed wholly to his boundleſs Ambition, that in which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62018:153"/>Love had as great a ſhare, if not the advantage. I ſhall leave it to the Reader's Judgment in the reading of this Second Part of the <hi>Court Secret;</hi> in which that Emperour's Private Amours are ſet forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Memories fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my hands.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Perſian</hi> Emperour had been advis'd by his Politick Council, to make choice of a Wife for <hi>Amurat,</hi> that might eſpouſe the <hi>Perſian</hi> Intereſt, be capable of governing him when he ſhould come to the Government, which right or wrong was to happen, according to the meaſures which they had taken, in the proſpect they had that <hi>Amurat</hi> was a great Proſelyte to that Sect. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Sultana</hi> was pitch'd upon as the moſt proper and fit perſon that could be had for that purpoſe. She was therefore choſen from a great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62018:154"/>number that aſpired at that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to become, in ſucceſs of time, the chiefeſt Inſtrument by which all the <hi>Haliſts</hi> ſhould work their Deſigns in that Empire. Of truth, her Wit, Addreſs, Preſence of Mind, Courage, Boldneſs, and exquiſite Beauty, which gave lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre to all her other excellencies, did highly contribute in rendring her Miſtreſs of <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fitted her above all other perſons in the World to carry on ſo great a Deſign.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sultana</hi> had formerly liv'd in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court, where <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had had the opportunity of admiring her Charms; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had been ſo abſolutely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd by them, as never to have been brought to reſign ſuch a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Beauties to another, when he had it at his diſpoſal, had he not been diverted from it, by the choiceſt Beauties of his Empire,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62018:154"/>which were daily offer'd to him, and the Shame which was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſet before his eyes, of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo fair an opportunity of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring himſelf Maſter of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, ſo much coveted and aimed at by his Predeceſſors, the Glory of the Performance being by his Fortunate Stars, reſerv'd for his invincible Arms, which would illuſtrate all his Conqueſts, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh for ever the Religion of <hi>Haly</hi> throughout the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and Crown him with eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Renown.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe and ſuch like Arguments, for that time, caus'd his Ambition to triumph over his Love; he yielded to their Advices, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to be led by Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, to the prejudice of Love, who enraged at the Aſſront, deveſted <hi>Cha-abas</hi> Heart from its Natural Severity, and infus'd it into the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Boſome, rendring it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62018:155"/>thereby ſo obdurate to all his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, that all his Repentance and Submiſſion ſhould not be of force to make in it the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                  <p>The violent Counſels of the <hi>Mufty Repſet,</hi> and other <hi>Haliſts,</hi> having been the occaſion of that prodigious and wonderful change in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, which had caus'd <hi>Amurat</hi> and the <hi>Sultana</hi> to retire into <hi>Perſia,</hi> from the Fury of an enraged Multitude, againſt whoſe Torrent no Bank of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Allegiance, or Loyalty can hold, and that nothing but its own impetuouſneſs can allay. They were oblig'd to run the ſame For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune alſo; the <hi>Mufti,</hi> like the reſt of his Order, not much troubling his Head at the wonderful Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he, with the aſſiſtance of others of his Fraternity, had wrought in <hi>Turky.</hi> Of truth it may be ſaid of that Society, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62018:155"/>they were ever true to that deſign they firſt took in hand, to ſtick to the Intereſt of the Houſe of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauta.</hi> That made them, when they found, notwithſtanding all their efforts, that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſtill grew more and more formidable, to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the <hi>Peſinians,</hi> they on the ſudden feign'd themſelves weary of protecting the <hi>Peſinians,</hi> made Overtures to wholly relinquiſh their Intereſt, and to come over to that of <hi>Perſia;</hi> which was greedily embrac'd by its Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who not diſtruſting them, did wholly relie on their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; they in the mean time, by that means and Stratagem, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the total Ruine of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, and the raiſing of the Houſe of <hi>Riſauta</hi> above whatever it had yet been. This made them to put <hi>Cha-abas</hi> upon glutting his Ambition by all baſe and violent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62018:156"/>Uſurpations, Breaches of Treaties Treacheries upon the Territories of thoſe Neighbouring Princes that were at Peace with him, which made the Grand <hi>Mufti</hi> himſelf to be affronted by him, by which doings he has now drawn upon him the hatred of all Princes, who have all joyn'd againſt him that will not hear of any Terms of Accommodation; who have oblig'd the <hi>Grand Mufti</hi> not to protect him, but to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him to the juſt Revenge of all thoſe Princes whom he has ſo highly offended, and that even will not aſſiſt <hi>Amurat</hi> in the leaſt in the recovery of his loſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, becauſe it has happen'd through his following the evil Counſels of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, though he is ſo great a Preſelyte to the Religion of <hi>Haly,</hi> of which moſt of thoſe Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Princes againſt <hi>Cha-abas</hi> are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62018:156"/>Profeſſors. Thus have the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metiſts,</hi> under pretence of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to <hi>Perſia,</hi> work'd thoſe Ends, and brought about thoſe purpoſes for the advantage of <hi>Peſina,</hi> which they could not compaſs by open force, and put the <hi>Peſinians</hi> by their entring into the Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in a Capacity of not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſuddenly all that <hi>Cha-abas</hi> has at ſeveral times baſely ſtol'n from them, but in ſharing alſo in that ſpoil which is intended of the whole <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire. I hope the Reader will pardon this Digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on condition that I will not trouble him with any more. And now I return to my Subject again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cha-abas</hi> having gone ſo far in his Deſign againſt the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, as to cauſe <hi>Amurat</hi> to deſert it, though his Deſigns were firſt quite different from what had happen'd, he deſign'd farther to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62018:157"/>make uſe of <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Deſertion of his Empire, to his particular advantage, which could not be done, without cauſing <hi>Amurat</hi> to change the Reſolution which his good Nature had promp'd him to, of retiring from the World into ſome Religious Place, there to end his days in Devotions. To this purpoſe <hi>Cha-abas</hi> gave Orders, That all perſons, from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the loweſt, in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould give the ſame reſpect to <hi>Amurat</hi> and to his <hi>Sultana,</hi> as they us'd to ſhew to himſelf; He caus'd them to be bravely and magnificently entertain'd in all places they paſs'd through, made his own Guards to attend them, and ſent his own Chariots to bring them to a magnificent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace which he had caus'd to be richly furniſh'd, and adorn'd with all neceſſary things for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and went ſome part of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62018:157"/>the way himſelf to receive them, with all the Demonſtrations of Sorrow imaginable, and all the Aſſurances of Friendſhip, Aid and Aſſiſtance that could be expected; proteſting, That notwithſtanding all thoſe formidable enemies which he had at that time on his hands, he would re-ſeat <hi>Amurat</hi> on his Throne; and that he would beg for Peace on his bare Knees of his enemies, rather than not purſue the deſtruction of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, which he was reſolv'd to accompliſh, happen what would, and to make <hi>Amurat</hi> a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and abſolute Prince in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire than ever any of his Predeceſſors had been.</p>
                  <p>Thus did that Vain Man, that Monſter of Pride, Cruelty, and Ambition, domineer and huff, when he knew not which way to turn himſelf, before the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Princes, who were all reſolv'd
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62018:158"/>to pull down his Pride, and to take from him at once all thoſe places, and whole Provinces which by fraud and deceit he had at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times encroached and ſtoln from them. He had firſt tried all means imaginable, and had apply'd himſelf to the <hi>Grand Mufti,</hi> and to the Emperour of <hi>Myrgena,</hi> with promiſes to reſtore all that he had gained from them; but they told him, that they knew him too well to truſt any longer to his Word, which he had never kept. So that finding that that would not do, he had propos'd to beg thoſe Princes Pardon which he had offended, and to make full reſtitution of all that he had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt himſelf of theirs, with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that he would ſubmit to all that they ſhould pleaſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon him, provided, they would but withdraw their Forces from falling upon him, till he had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62018:158"/>accompliſh'd that great Deſign he had ſo well begun, of totally rooting out the true <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion: But thoſe Confederate Princes knowing, that all that he ſaid, was but to divert them from taking revenge of all his perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealings againſt them; and that at the very time that he ſo earneſtly begg'd for a Peace, he was animating and fomenting the <hi>Heathens,</hi> to continuing a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Mahometiſts;</hi> they therefore gave no ear to any thing he ſaid, but went on ſtill with their preparations of War againſt him, with all the vigour imaginable.</p>
                  <p>This made <hi>Cha-abas</hi> to look out for a place of Retreat in time, in caſe he ſhould be driven out of his own Empire; but he did it with that ſame Pride and Oſtentation which uſually accompanies all his Actions. He caſt his eye on the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62018:159"/>Iſland <hi>Leridan,</hi> pertaining to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat,</hi> and which ſtill held out for him, all the Natives of that Kingdom being <hi>Haliſts,</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by <hi>Clorinet,</hi> who was a great <hi>Haliſt</hi> alſo, and who had been plac'd in that ſtation by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After then that he had brought <hi>Amurat</hi> and his <hi>Sultana</hi> to that Palace which he had appointed for them, and ſettled an Allowance for their Maintenance ſuitable to their Greatneſs, he began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider which way to begin, and in what proper Terms to propoſe to <hi>Amurat,</hi> ſo that he might not find out his drift, the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ction of <hi>Clonſtad</hi> and of <hi>Albiona</hi> to him; but <hi>Amurat</hi> was not long without giving him himſelf a fair opportunity of declaring his Mind; for he being ſtill dejected and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolable, for the loſs of the Love of his Subjects, without which he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62018:159"/>had no proſpect of ever recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Right again, did ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Deſign which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, of leaving the World, and of retiring into ſome Religious Houſe, where to end his days in peace and quietneſs, and menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd his Deſign to <hi>Cha-abas.</hi> There needed no more to ſet the <hi>Perſian</hi> Emperour on, this was matter ſufficient for him to work upon: He repreſented to <hi>Amurat,</hi> that that would tarniſh the Glory of all his former Actions; it would give occaſion to the World to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, and to future Ages to entertain a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> very ill Opinion of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He added, That he himſelf was ſo highly concern'd in the whole Buſineſs, that it would greatly tarniſh that Glory which the Juſtice of his Cauſe, and the good ſucceſs of his Arms had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him, if he did not re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh <hi>Amurat</hi> on his Throne, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62018:160"/>totally root out of all his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, as he had already done out of his own Empire, and would do out of the whole World, before he would be quiet: That a War which was founded on Religion, and the extirpation of Hereſies, as his was, was not to be left undone, being of quite another Nature than thoſe Wars which are made on the account of ſecuring ones Right, enlarging of ones Dominions, increaſing of ones Glory, and the like; That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever once ſet his his Hand to that Plough, wherein Religion was concern'd, was not to look back, but to go forwards, over all the Hazards and Difficulties imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being confident, that the more perillous, the more glorious the Achievement of the thing would be; that he was ready to aſſiſt him with Men, Arms, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition

                     <hi>Cha-abas</hi> finding that <hi>Amurat</hi> began to ſhake in the handle, thought of making uſe of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means which had ſucceeded ſo well before, which was, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Sultana</hi> on following cloſe by Night thoſe Leſſons which he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62018:161"/>and the <hi>Mufties</hi> of his Party did continually buz in <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Ears all the Day long; which made <hi>Amurat</hi> to believe himſelf in a worſe condition than ever; and of truth, meerly to rid himſelf of that continual trouble that he ſaw himſelf expoſed unto, by thoſe perpetual Tongue-Batteries, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd againſt his Conſtancy and Reſolutions, he yielded to their Efforts, and began to capitulate with <hi>Cha-abas</hi> about the Buſineſs. <hi>Cha-abas</hi> told him, that he had no other end in it, than the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of him on his Throne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and, all under one, to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate Hereſie: But that becauſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat</hi> had been ſo unſucceſsful in his former Deſigns, for want of good Counſellors and Officers, to perform and execute thoſe Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the Councils had taken, he did think it not only conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, but very neceſſary to give
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62018:161"/>him ſuch a Counſellor as they might both truſt in for Fidelity and Conduct; that to avoid all occaſion of Murmurs amongſt his Subjects, who would all expect Relief from the Monies which he ſhould tranſport with him, there ſhould go along with him a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Treaſurer, that ſhould have the whole and ſole diſpoſal of his Treaſure; and that neither of his Subjects, either <hi>Haliſts</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> that were Officers, ſhould envy one another, (for thoſe laſt were to be a little while longer conſider'd) he would ſend alſo ſome <hi>Perſian</hi> Officers to be put in all ſtrong places to command the Army, and to govern the Military Affairs, as occaſions ſhould ſerve: So that <hi>Amurat</hi> ſhould have nothing to do, but to countenance the whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as being made in his Name, and on his Account, till the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62018:162"/>was ended; and that then he ſhould take upon him again the whole management of Affairs, and Rule as Emperour there, and recover, through <hi>Cha-abas</hi> continued aſſiſtance, the reſt of his loſt Empire.</p>
                  <p>All theſe ſugar'd Bates did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat</hi> ſwallow down, with the greateſt ſecurity that could be, not ſo much as once doubting in the leaſt, but that all that <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abas</hi> ſaid, was real and ſincere: He therefore reſolv'd once again to launch himſelf into the World, and through <hi>Cha-abas</hi> kind aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, go and recover his loſt Empire. <hi>Amurat</hi> having taken this Reſolution, and having paſt his Word to <hi>Cha-abas</hi> of being wholly and abſolutely govern'd by him, to ſee whether that would alter the ill ſucceſs which he had had hitherto in all his Undertakings. There was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62018:162"/>Rejoycings at it; <hi>Amurat</hi> had Liberty to breathe again, and was no longer tormented with the continual Alarms which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Day and Night from thoſe whom <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had appointed to torment him. But there happen'd another Obſtacle, which was to be remov'd, as a great Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Cha-abas</hi> other Deſigns: So far he had conſulted but his own Pride and Ambition; but Love claim'd a ſhare in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome alſo, and the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Charms had already made ſo deep an impreſſion in his heart, that it was impoſſible for him to yield to thoſe earneſt Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Prayers which ſhe made, that ſhe might attend on <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> in that Expedition; He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to her the Seaſon of the Year, the Inconſtancy of the Elements that ſhe would expoſe her ſelf to, the Uncertainty of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62018:163"/>the Succeſs, the Inconveniencies of lying long at Sea, of Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt Enemies, of going from a pure to an unwholeſome corrupt Air, where diſeaſed men might make it ſtill more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. In fine, he himſelf, and thoſe whom he ſet on the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi> to diſſwade her from going, acted ſo well their Parts, that not only the <hi>Sultana,</hi> but <hi>Amurat</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (who had already given his Conſent for the <hi>Sultana</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him,) did reſolve, that ſhe ſhould reſt behind, at leaſt, till it were convenient for her to come over: Mean time, all Diſpatches were made for the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den putting in execution what had been deſign'd and agreed on betwixt the Two Emperours; inſomuch, that in a ſhort time <hi>Amurat</hi> was told, that the Fleet, and all the things neceſſary for his Expedition, were in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62018:163"/>and ready to ſet Sail, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they wanted his Perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which nothing could be done. Thus was <hi>Amurat</hi> ſent away from his <hi>Sultana,</hi> to countenance <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abas</hi> Deſigns on <hi>Leridan,</hi> and to give more Liberty to his amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Intrigues. For no ſooner was <hi>Amurat</hi> gone, but that <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abas</hi> laid cloſe Siege unto the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Vertues, and follow'd it ſo cloſe, that he prevented the Deſign which ſhe had taken, and which doubtleſs ſhe had execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of confining her ſelf into ſome Society of Religious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, during <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Abſence, had not <hi>Cha-abas</hi> Love been very diligent in breaking her meaſures. He had not yet made any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Love to her, and all thoſe Services and Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Reſpect which he ſhew'd her, paſs'd but for the effects of his Courteſie and Civility, to a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62018:164"/>Princeſs in affliction: He had had ſome thoughts of declaring his Paſſion, but he thought it was not to be done in a mean and ordinary method, but in ſuch a manner as ſhould correſpond with his Glory, the Greatneſs of the <hi>Sultana,</hi> and the Exceſs of his Paſſion. He daily did afford her new Divertiſements, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there ſtill reign'd over the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Brow, a certain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Air, which though it added no ſmall Luſtre unto the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Majeſtick Gravity, yet did not ſo well anſwer his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Deſigns towards her; he reſolv'd upon communicating of his Deſigns unto <hi>Clorineta,</hi> Wife to <hi>Clorinet,</hi> who had accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Sultana</hi> from <hi>Turky</hi> into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and all along been Privy to all the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Contrivances, Plots and Intrigues, and in whom the <hi>Sultana</hi> put all her Confidence and Truſt.</p>

                  <p>We have had no occaſion in the Firſt Part of the <hi>Court Secret</hi> to mention this Perſon, but having divers opportunities to bring her upon the Stage in this Second Part, it is fitting that I ſhould give you a ſhort Deſcription of her: She was very handſome yet, though ſome few years had of late left ſome Traces behind them, which ſpoke the Relicks of a very exquiſite Beauty; and her gay Humour, free Air, and Natural Amorous Diſpoſition, did ſtill perſwade her, and not without Cauſe, that ſhe had Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough left to captivate the Heart even of the proudeſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the World; and ſhe had divers times tacitely within her ſelf, wiſh'd that thoſe Addreſſes at large which <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had made to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> had been deſign'd to her, who had certainly given them more favourable Receptions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62018:165"/>and Returns, than he might ever expect from the more vertuouſly ſtrait-laced <hi>Sultana,</hi> not without hopes that ſhe might thereby gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thoſe Two Paſſions of Love and Gain, which had ſtill ſo great an Aſcendant over her, and which made her deſign within her ſelf to make a Prize of <hi>Cha-abas;</hi> in which ſhe was already confident ſhe ſhould not be oppos'd by the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who as ſhe found her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd, eſpecially at that time, would rather encourage and aſſiſt her in her Deſign, than thwart it, in hopes that it would in part di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thoſe Addreſſes which <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abas</hi> might diſturb her quiet with, and which ſhe could not tell how handſomly to avoid, conſidering the Obligations which both ſhe and <hi>Amurat</hi> ſeem to have unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cha-abas</hi> then watching for an opportunity of entertaining <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineta</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62018:165"/>on that Subject, did one day find her all alone, walking in a private cover'd Walk in the Garden, where ſhe had given an aſſignation unto the <hi>Mufti Repſet,</hi> who was one of her Favourites. <hi>Cha-abas</hi> came up to her, and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her; <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I may thank my good Fortune for giving me this fair opportunity of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to you ſomething of neareſt concern to me, and on which depends my Happineſs or Miſery.</hi> This On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet did ſo tickle <hi>Clorineta</hi>'s Heart, expecting nothing leſs than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Love from that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, after ſo fair a beginning, that ſhe could not forbear aſſuring him, that whatever he ſhould ſay unto her, would be ſo great an Honour, as ſhe would loſe a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Lives to merit it, and that it would be all her ſtudy how ſhe ſhould anſwer ſo great a Monarch's Deſires, wih all the Humility and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62018:166"/>Reſpect imaginable; and at the ſame time ſhe wiſh'd with all her Heart, within her ſelf, that her <hi>Mufti</hi> ſhould forget the Aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or miſtake the Time or Place, that his coming might not interrupt <hi>Cha-abas</hi> Diſcourſes, nor create in him the leaſt Jealouſie and Suſpicion. <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> on his part, deſiring not to be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted neither, and for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen by the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who us'd to walk ſometimes there, ſaid, <hi>Madam, if you will honour me ſo far as to accompany me to y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>After <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had ſeated <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta</hi> and himſelf, fetching a great Sigh from the bottom of his Heart, he thus began, <hi>This fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of my Diſcourſe, Madam, does but too much inform you of the Nature of it, without any further clearing of the buſineſs, and letting of you know, that it is Love, that All-powerful Deity, who makes me ſigh in his Chains: Yet, Madam, it were in vain for me to deny or go about to conceal a Paſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Notwithſtanding that theſe Two laſt Words had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to have enlightned a leſs diſcerning perſon than was <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta,</hi> yet ſhe was ſo puff'd up with her good Fortune, and ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with the Opinion, that all that <hi>Cha-abas</hi> ſaid, was meant to her, that ſhe went confidently on, taking all to her ſelf, and framing Anſwers ſuitable to her imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſhe return'd to <hi>Cha-abas</hi> with ſuch amorous Glances, ſuch pathetick Expreſſions, and ſuch paſſionate Zeal, that <hi>Cha-abas</hi> could not but take notice of it, and believing it to be as it was, and finding her worthy ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, he let her remain in her miſtake, and reſolv'd to take hold of an opportunity which offer'd it ſelf ſo fairly: therefore he thus continued, <hi>Yes, Madam, You have ſo many Charms, and they ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, that ſhould you be my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

But that did but ſerve to diſcover the more viſibly the ſet Aſſignation which had been betwixt them; for <hi>Repſet</hi> who had had an Eye of her at a diſtance, which caus'd him to redouble his pace, made a ſtop at the foot of ſome ſteps that led up to the Pavillion, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62018:172"/>Religion, and all the Laws that had from time to time been made for its preſervation, againſt all the Aſſaults and Conſpiracies of its ſworn Enemies the <hi>Haliſts,</hi> and to protect and defend his People from all Forreign Uſurpation and Invaſion; and his People on their part had promis'd to obey him, as their King and Governour, and to pay unto him the ſame Allegiance and Obedience, which they had done to his Predeceſſors, on the aſſurance that he would faithfully and inviolably keep and obſerve his Coronation Oath. I ſay, that many of his Loyal Subjects did believe, and thought in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that the Emperour's Breach of his Oaths had diſpenc'd them from thoſe which they had taken to him of their Allegiance. Yet there remain'd ſome amongſt them, who ſtill were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That though <hi>Amurat</hi> had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62018:173"/>broke his Coronation-Oath, that did not free them from thoſe Oaths of Allegiance to him which they had taken, ſaying, That his doing ill, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Errour, was no warrant for them to do the ſame. But when it came to that paſs, that the Emperour deſerted them and his Kingdoms, and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd to the protecting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of them: Nay, That on the contrary, he joyn'd with the <hi>Haliſts</hi> againſt his own People, and applied himſelf to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt declared Enemy of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, and of the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Religion, which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd over and over, he would root out of the World; then, I ſay, that help'd to take off all thoſe Scruples which had been left on their tender Conſciences, and found, that what at firſt was but ſtrife, who ſhould have the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62018:173"/>upper hand, of the <hi>Haliſts</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, was now turn'd into a War of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in which the true ancient <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, the Laws of the Land, the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject were concern'd. In fine, where all lay at ſtake, and in which he that had ſworn to be their Protector and Defender, was gone over to the greateſt Enemy of all their Rights, and had ſolicited him againſt his own People; then they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abſolutely freed from all Duties to him, and from all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſive Obedience, which was ſo much enjoyn'd to them by the Doctrine of their Church, who commanded them to fly from Perſecution in their own Land by their own Prince, into another, after that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and abandoned them to their Deſtruction, and joyn'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62018:174"/>to the implacable Enemy of their Religion, Eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Nation. Then they thought that their ſtaying at home for the Defence of their own Religion, and to oppoſe the threatned Uſurpation and Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Haliſts</hi> under <hi>Cha-abas</hi> conduct, was the ſame thing as their flying from Perſecution at home into another Country, now that their Head, their King, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector had abandon'd them to the Fury of their moſt barbarous and bloody Enemies; was the ſame thing as flying from Perſecution. had their Emperor ſtaid to protect them.</p>
                  <p>They therefore joyntly Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prince <hi>Soliman</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Zelinda,</hi> as the next Heirs to the Crown, which had been forfeited to them by <hi>Amurat</hi>'s abandoning of it; and they took thoſe uſual Oaths which are tender'd to all the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62018:174"/>Emperour's at their Coronation; and the People acknowledg'd them to be their Lawful King and Queen, and on that account ſwore to them the Oaths of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Allegiance and Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which were uſual on ſuch occaſion; all which was confirm'd by the Grand Council of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, receiv'd in all parts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd throughout the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, except by a ſmall Party of <hi>Haliſts,</hi> which had been kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Arms in <hi>Leridan</hi> by <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinet,</hi> after he had turn'd out from amongſt them all thoſe that profeſt the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>News by this time are come to <hi>Iſpahan</hi> of the <hi>Perſians</hi> Fleet ſafe arrival at <hi>Leridan,</hi> where they had diſcharg'd their Men and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and where <hi>Amurat</hi> at his firſt Landing, had obtain'd a conſiderable Advantage over his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62018:175"/>Enemies, and had great hopes to ſubdue that Kingdom, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thoſe Forces afterwards into the Kingdom of <hi>Clonſtade,</hi> where there was a great Party ready to receive him; from whence, after that was recover'd, he would march with his Conquering Army into <hi>Albona,</hi> and ſo make himſelf once more Maſter of his Empire. Theſe Letters were ſhown to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who not finding the ſame Contents in <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Letters to her, nor in <hi>Clorinet</hi>'s Letters to his Wife, ſo clearly ſet down, did fear giving too much Credit to them; but what with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing which was put on the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s and <hi>Clorineta</hi>'s Letters, the <hi>Sultana</hi> was perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that was told her, as moſt authentick, which made her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to breathe a little, and to give ſome releaſe unto her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Sorrow, in appearing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62018:175"/>to her Grandeur and Rank at the great Mask, with all the Mirth and Jolity that her preſent Condition could afford her to yield.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cha-abas</hi> was ſo ſtrongly bent on this great Deſign, that one would have thought he had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buſineſs in hand; He laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all other Concerns, and did reſolve, happen what would, to give all the Scope and Liberty imaginable to his Amours, which made ſuch a noiſe, that ſome of the more Sober ſort of his Court did not think convenient to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at that great Feſtival, at a time when the Bleſſing of Heaven was to have been implor'd upon their Arms againſt ſo many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Enemies that did encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs them round: Of truth there was not leſs than 157000 Men arm'd againſt <hi>Perſia:</hi> There was of the <hi>Myrgenians</hi> 7000, of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62018:176"/>
                     <hi>Abravians</hi> 10000. of the <hi>Wasbians</hi> 5000 under the Conduct of the moſt Valiant <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Abravia.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Reinola</hi> had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of 20000. <hi>Myrgenians</hi> and <hi>Cranfonians,</hi> 10000. <hi>Xoniſeans,</hi> 8000. <hi>Swibrunckians</hi> and <hi>Brugul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans,</hi> and 8000 <hi>Seheſeans:</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Grubdenbran</hi> commanded of <hi>Grubdenbranians</hi> 26000. and of <hi>Stennumians</hi> 6000: The <hi>Aga Kalkwad</hi> led 50000. <hi>Halldonians,</hi> and there was 7000. <hi>Peſinians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the formidable Navies which threatned him by Sea. All theſe, I ſay, could not abate any thing of his Ambition, eſpecially now that it was boy'd up, and carried on the Wings of Love. At laſt, his particular <hi>Mufti,</hi> unto whom only he imparted the Secrets of his Heart, was pitch'd upon to repreſent to him the unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the thing, and the great inconveniences that would
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62018:176"/>attend it. But he ſeverely rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him for his unask'd for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and deſired him not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him with his Counſels, till he ſent for him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mufti,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> was but newly return'd home, not much concern'd how he had ſucceeded in his Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> when <hi>Repſet</hi> came to give him a Viſit. They were both of the wicked Order of the <hi>Mahometiſts:</hi> They had held perpetual Correſpondence by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with one another; all the time that the Deſtruction of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion in <hi>Albiona</hi> had been hatching, they were very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar together, and no Secret was hid from one another but in their Amours; there they were Two, as unanimous ſoever they were in all other Buſineſſes. <hi>Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi>'s Deſign in that Viſit was to learn, whether <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had ſaid
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62018:177"/>any thing to <hi>Chilaſe</hi> concerning the miſtake which he had lately made in the Garden: He had made his Peace well enough with <hi>Clorineta,</hi> but he would gladly have known how the Emperour had reſented it, and what his thoughts might be on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>Chilaſe</hi> told him, That he had not ſpoken but once ſince to <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> who was ſo atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his great Entertainment, that then he had rebuk'd him for offering to give him ſome Advice about it, which he had been deſired to do by ſome of the principal Lords of the Court: <hi>But let him go on,</hi> continued he, <hi>we ſhall have the ſatisfaction of being partakers of it. Yes,</hi> ſaid Repſet, <hi>though not in ſo high a meaſure as he deſigns for himſelf: Of truth it muſt be confeſſed,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, <hi>the New Object of his Love, which puts him on all this,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62018:177"/>has ſuch powerful charms, that no Fleſh and Blood were able to reſiſt. You ſpeak ſo feelingly of the Effects of thoſe charms,</hi> reply'd Chilaſe, <hi>that I cannot but fancy you are more than ordinary intereſted in it. No Brother,</hi> reply'd Repſet, <hi>the great number of cares that I had continually upon me, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them, did keep me off of any ſuch Deſigns, though certainly ſhe is the fineſt Perſon in the World, the moſt courteous and affable to the meaneſt of her Subjects; and it is a thouſand pities that ſhe has an Husband who is not capable, through his infirmities, to perform towards her thoſe Matrimonial Devoirs which ſhe ought in reaſon to expect, and which</hi> 100000 <hi>Perſons would think themſelves moſt happy to ſupply her with. What pity then is it,</hi> ſaid Chilaſe, <hi>that ſhe ſhould now be courted by another Prince as inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to perform to any purpoſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62018:178"/>thoſe amorous Offices, which in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe might expect, were ſhe in the leaſt flexible to his applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? But, in my Opinion, ſhe has not the Air, carries not that Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Humour, that Briskneſs, which uſually ſpeaks a Perſon amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. No more do many other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> anſwer'd Repſet, <hi>who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs are all Love: I tell you, that any perſon that would manage that buſineſs diſcreetly, might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from her more than you think, if they did but obſerve to nick her reſerv'd Humour, and to make no noiſe of it; and were I in your place, I know what I would do. Repſet</hi>'s Deſign in engaging <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſe</hi> in an Amour with the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> was to divert him from look<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing in, and having any thoughts towards <hi>Clorineta</hi> who had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he thought, too much to <hi>Chilaſe</hi>'s advantage, and had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd to him a great deſire to be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62018:178"/>more particularly acquainted with him; beſides, he had once found <hi>Chilaſe</hi> in a very cloſe Diſcourſe with <hi>Clorineta;</hi> all which did not pleaſe him very well: wherefore he endeavour'd to create in him ſome Deſires towards the <hi>Sultana,</hi> that might make a Diverſion; ſo that he might not hereafter thwart him in his Amours to <hi>Clorineta. Chilaſe</hi> ſwallow'd the Bate, and though he ſeem'd not to take much notice of what <hi>Repſet</hi> ſpoke concerning the <hi>Sultana,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd within himſelf, from that moment, to puſh his Fortune, and try what he could do in gaining the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s good Will by ſome ſignal Pieces of Services, though to the prejudice of his Maſter <hi>Cha-abas</hi> Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>From theſe Particular Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they fell to Generals, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Grand Mask, where they could not forbear mentioning the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62018:179"/>great Opportunities it gave to Courtſhip, addreſs'd indifferently to any perſon, under thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, and by conſent to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Men and Women, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand had agreed on ways of knowing one another: That there the meaneſt Perſon in the World, for a little Money and Coſt, might be admitted to hazard his Fortune with the beſt in the Land, if he had but Wit, Confidence and Addreſs; <hi>For Example,</hi> ſaid Chilaſe, <hi>If you or I ſhould have a fancy to try what thoſe Masking Meetings termine to, how eaſie would it be for us to ſo diſguiſe our ſelves, as to enjoy all the pleaſure and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the whole Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not be diſcover'd? You ſay true,</hi> anſwer'd Repſet; <hi>but I am ſo far from any ſuch thought, that I deſign that day to take the Air out of Town, and lye all night at a Friends Houſe, to whom I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62018:179"/>have long owed a Viſit. And I,</hi> ſaid Chilaſe, <hi>deſign to take Phy ſick that day; for of late I have ſound my ſelf indiſpos'd, and that Day and Night I ſhall not need to fear the trouble of impertinent Viſits.</hi> With theſe and ſuch like Diſcourſes they ended the Day: <hi>Repſet</hi> took his leave, and went to viſit his <hi>Clorineta;</hi> and <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſe</hi> fell muſing on thoſe Fancies which <hi>Repſet</hi> had put in his Head: The more he thought on it, the more it rais'd his thoughts, the more bold it made him, and the more deſirous to attempt the thing: He thought that this Masking Bout was ſuch a fair opportunity to try his Fortune in, that he was not to let it ſlip, leſt he ſhould never meet with ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The <hi>Sultana</hi> repreſented her ſelf to his Imagination, all Charming; and the very thoughts of enjoying ſo great a Princeſs, ſo
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62018:180"/>lovely a Perſon, did almoſt raviſh him beyond his Senſes. <hi>I will puſh on my Fortune,</hi> ſaid he to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>and try what I may hope or fear for the future, by the ſucceſs of my firſt Attempt, in which my Diſguiſe will ſecure me from all Dangers: And what if there were never ſo many Dangers, who would regard them? Who would not paſs over the greateſt Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties imaginable, to attain to ſo much Happineſs? Well, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, and I will early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begin to prepare for ſo glorious an Enterpriſe.</hi> With this Reſolution he went to his Bed, though not to ſleep.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt thoſe Perſons which the <hi>Sultana</hi> admitted to her Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ladies, was <hi>Monitenna,</hi> who was moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in Love with <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> and whoſe Jealous Humour had occaſion'd her to ſeek for a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62018:180"/>Friendſhip with the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and with <hi>Clorineta,</hi> that ſhe might the better pry into their Actions, and break all their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> who ſhe knew had a Love for them both: She diſguiſed the Love which ſhe had for <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Duty in the Care ſhe had taken, and ſtill took of him in his Diſtemper, and of a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Gratitude towards him for ſo mony Favours and great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which ſhe had receiv'd: And ſhe did endeavour by all manner of means, ſo to oblige them both, that they were forc'd to receive her into their particular Favour, even in Gratitude. That ſight which ſhe had had of the Emperour with <hi>Clorineta,</hi> ſtuck by her; and ſhe apprehended more danger that way, than from the <hi>Sultana,</hi> whom ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd had not yet any inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62018:181"/>for <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> while the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did nothing elſe all day long, but extol him to the very Skyes, and expreſs'd the great deſires ſhe had of carrying on that firſt Interview which ſhe had had with him, into a perfect A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Intrigue. Mean time, <hi>Monitenna</hi> plaid ſo well the part of an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oncern'd perſon, ſtill extolling his Liberality and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, that <hi>Clorineta,</hi> who was of a very free and open Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made her her Confident in her amorous Deſigns. <hi>Repſet</hi> ſtill follow'd cloſe his Game with <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineta,</hi> and being deſirous to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Mask and Ball, he propos'd it to her, and they both agreed in what Diſguiſes they ſhould be, not to be known but by them Two only; at leaſt, <hi>Repſet</hi> was not to be known; but as to <hi>Clorineta,</hi> ſhe was to be known by the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who was to know
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62018:181"/>her alſo, deſigning alſo to make her ſelf known to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by ſome private Mark. The Cauſe of her eaſie yielding to <hi>Repſet</hi>'s Deſires, was becauſe ſhe knew him to be violent; and that if ſhe ſhould offer to oppoſe him in that which ſhe believ'd was put on by ſome Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie which he had entertain'd of <hi>Cha-abas</hi> ever ſince he had found them together, though ſhe had endeavour'd by all means imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to let him know there was nothing leſs than Love in the Caſe, and that it was a meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Rencounter, and that all the Diſcourſe they had was on the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Beauty, with which <hi>Cha-abas</hi> ſeem'd to be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly captivated: She fear'd that it might carry him to do ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant thing, which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to her prejudice; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſhe reſolv'd to put the Change
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62018:182"/>upon him, and to dreſs one of her Women in thoſe Diſguiſes which ſhe had deſign'd for her ſelf, and put on others, which ſhould not be known but by the <hi>Sultana</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitenna.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Chilaſe</hi> in the mean time had by the Vertue of Gold (a thing with which the <hi>Perſians</hi> uſe to work Miracles), got the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Diſguiſe; ſo that he was in all Points ready for the Mask. <hi>Monitenna,</hi> who had from <hi>Cha-abas</hi> himſelf, how he was to appear, and who had inform'd him in what Dreſs the <hi>Sultana</hi> was to be, as alſo of the firſt Dreſs which <hi>Clorineta</hi> had pitch'd upon, had no more to do, but to fit her ſelf with all the means imaginable to do all the Miſchief ſhe could poſſible, and to create a Confuſion amongſt theſe Lovers.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:62018:182"/>
                  <p>At laſt the Day came in whoſe following Night the Ball was to begin: There never was a more ſplendid appearance; There was nothing to be ſeen but <hi>Tiſſu</hi>'s, Cloaths of Gold and Silver, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries with Pearls and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones, and whole Rocks of Diamonds, which, with the light of a Thouſand White Wax Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, plac'd in Silver and Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Candleſticks and Sconces, did produce a light more piercing than that of the Sun in its full <hi>Meridian,</hi> contracted within the limits of a moſt ſpacious Hall.</p>
                  <p>The Maskers being all enter'd, and after ſome Dances having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their Seats at the upper end of the Hall, there were heard in the Air moſt admirable Conſorts of Muſick, of Voices, of Flutes, and of other Inſtruments, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, and ſometimes all together, ſinging all in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62018:183"/>praiſe of Love. During theſe Harmonies, which charm'd not leſs the Ears than the Maskers did the Eyes. There appear'd towards the middle of the Hall, like a Flock of flying Hearts, of all ſorts and Sizes, fluttering in the Air, to which preſently came flying a little <hi>Cupid</hi> with his Bow and Arrows, ſhooting at the whole Flock ſtill as he flew, with little Silver Shafts. At laſt he ſhot the biggeſt of all the Hearts that were in the whole Flock, which tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down on the Floor, tranſpier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the Shaft, and bleeding, the little <hi>Cupid</hi> made after it with all the Wing he had, and lighting on the Ground, ſeiz'd on the Heart, with which he began to play Childiſh Tricks. At laſt he looks round on all the Ladies, as if deſigning to beſtow it on one of them; He walks round, and not knowing to whom to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62018:183"/>it, he falls a crying, lays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down by the Heart, puſhes it from him, kicks it, ſtill lying; and plays a Thouſand little Apiſh Tricks with it, pouting, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſullen. As he was toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, comes, as from out of the Hangings, which repreſented whole Figures to the Life, a <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and the Three Graces. They come up to <hi>Cupid,</hi> who perceiving them, takes the Heart, and huggs it in his Arms, as afraid they ſhould take it from him: <hi>Venus</hi> begs it of him, he kicks at her; ſhe offers to take it, he defends it; the Graces aſſiſt <hi>Venus</hi> in the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it from him; he ſcrambles with them, kicks one, pinches another, ſcratches a Third, ſpits at the Fourth; and finding that they were too many for him, he on the ſudden having ſecur'd the Heart betwixt his Thighs, catches up his Bow, and pulls out an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62018:184"/>to ſhoot; at which they all run away and left him; he laught at them, laid himſelf down again, and began to fool as before; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after comes out as from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Hanging, <hi>Old Time</hi> with his Wings and his Scythe, leading in one Hand <hi>Fortune</hi> with a Vail over her Eyes, a Sail in her Hand, a Wheel on her Head, and in the Name of it a Golden Ball, and in the other Hand <hi>Fame,</hi> with her Two Trumpets, her Gown all over beſtrew'd with Ears and Eyes. They come up to <hi>Cupid,</hi> he ſeems pleas'd with them, but ſtill ſecures the Heart; He plays with the Feathers of <hi>Times</hi> Wings, gives <hi>Fortune</hi> a blow, then hides himſelf behind <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Fame;</hi> while ſhe gropes after him, he gets one of <hi>Fame</hi>'s Trumpets, and blows in it: They let him play ſo with them, till he gets into a good Humour, which <hi>Time</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62018:184"/>he leads him by the Hand towards the Ladies: <hi>Cupid</hi> ſeems baſhful at firſt; at laſt takes a round, and after divers offers to ſeveral Ladies, he lays it in the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s lap, and preſently flies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>Time, Fortune</hi> and <hi>Fame</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone before.</p>
                  <p>This Heart was no ſooner laid in the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s lap, but that ſhe was ſurpriz'd to ſee it open, fall in pieces, and diſcover it ſelf to be within ſide a whole Cluſter of Diamonds and Pearls, in the midſt of which was a Paper neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly folded, which ſhe had a great mind to open, and to ſee what it contain'd; but ſhe was unwilling to gratifie her Deſires at that time, becauſe that all the reſt of the Maskers had their Eyes fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her: However, her Curioſity was ſo great, that ſhe could not forbear turning up one Corner of it, in which having read the Word
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62018:185"/>
                     <hi>Love,</hi> ſhe ſecretly convey'd it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Pocket, together with the Heart, and took no further notice. By this time a large Table fill'd with all manner of Delicacies, ſprung up as out of the Floor, with Seats round it; and out of the Hangings round, came out divers Servants with Bottles of all ſorts of Liquors, and Glaſſes, which were ſupply'd by others, which appear'd but half in and half out of the ſaid Hangings, ſtill ſhifting of Glaſſes after they had once been us'd. The Maskers did all riſe, went and ſeated themſelves round the Table, and took of what they lik'd beſt, with which ſome ſtor'd their Pockets, others their Handkerchiefs, which they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after on the Stools on which they were ſeated before; after which the Table and Chairs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared again. The Conſorts ceas'd, and the Four and Twenty
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62018:185"/>Violins ſtruck up ſome Tunes, to invite the Maskers to dance; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had danced ſo long as it was thought convenient, there appear'd other Maskers, no body knowing how they came in, who danc'd divers Sarabrands, and other Antick Dances, very pleaſant and diverting. Which ended, and the Dancers retired, then did all the Maskers promiſcuouſly mix toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and every one apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as his Fancy led him.</p>
                  <p>It was then that <hi>Cha-abas</hi> took the opportunity of addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the <hi>Sultana;</hi> and under his Diſguiſes did take a greater liberty than he durſt have done at another time, of mentioning his Love to her; each moment ſeeming very tedious unto <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> who was watching at a diſtance for the time that <hi>Cha-abas</hi> would give the <hi>Sultana</hi> ſome reſpite, that he might tell her what he had to ſay. <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineta</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:62018:186"/>was not leſs impatient on the other hand, and thought it long before the <hi>Sultana</hi> diſmiſs'd the Emperour, as ſhe had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to do, that ſhe might have the opportunity of entertaining him in her turn. Mean time <hi>Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi> was plying his time tooth and nail in his Courtſhip to <hi>Clorine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>'s Woman, thinking her to be the Miſtreſs, with no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign than to hinder a Commerce betwixt <hi>Cha-abas</hi> and <hi>Clorineta.</hi> While all the Maskers were thus buſie in entertaining one another, and ſometimes ſhifting from one another, either for the ſake of meer change, or to meet with ſome particular Perſon that they had a mind to entertain, to find out ſome other that anſwer'd more home to their Propoſitions, or to take breath when they had ſpoken all they had to ſay. The jealous <hi>Monitenna</hi> was obſerving all the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62018:186"/>paſſages betwixt thoſe Perſons with which ſhe was concern'd, ſhe ſaw how that ſo ſoon as the <hi>Sultana</hi> had ſhifted from <hi>Cha-abas, Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta</hi> had ſupply'd her room, in paſſing opportunely by juſt in the nick, which had made the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to detain her, and try her Wit. It troubled her not a little to ſee that her long detaining of <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> had made him once or twice offer at a Change, which in Civility is always left to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans choice, and how ſtill ſhe had ingag'd him a-new, and held him faſt by the hand, that he might not go from her, till ſhe had emptied her mind; ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd how that the <hi>Mufti Chilaſe</hi> had done the ſame with the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi> and how hot he was upon his Deſign. At laſt ſhe had the ſatisfaction to ſee <hi>Clorineta</hi> let go <hi>Cha-abas</hi> hand; but that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was daſh'd again, by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62018:187"/>Whiſper which ſhe ſaw <hi>Cha-abas</hi> give her, and how that he then took the opportunity of kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her neck. Thoſe were ſo many points of Daggers in poor <hi>Monitenna</hi>'s Heart, which haſten'd her the more to put in execution that Revenge which ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cha-abas</hi> being thus diſingag'd of <hi>Monitenna</hi>'s long Converſation, ſought after none but the <hi>Sultana,</hi> to whom he thought he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſufficient time to recollect, and fit her ſelf for a ſecond Charge; but perceiving a Perſon very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with her, he was ſo diſcreet, as to entertain himſelf with the next Lady he met near her, till he ſhould find the place empty, which our amorous <hi>Mufti Chilaſe</hi> did ſtill poſſeſs. <hi>Monitenna</hi> being ready to play her Game, ſtep'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to <hi>Repſet,</hi> and whiſper'd him in the Ear, that he was miſtaken,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62018:187"/>and that <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Clorineta</hi> all that while, who he had but juſt now quitted, and that if he would follow her, ſhe would bring him to her. <hi>Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi> who had two or three times been ſurpriſed at the Diſcourſes of the Woman which he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and at her unwillingneſs to ſpeak, but when oblig'd to give an Anſwer, though ſhe would ſometimes ſpeak pretty pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as knowing her Lady's Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues with <hi>Repſet,</hi> did believe the Intelligence which had been given him to be real, and ſo follow'd <hi>Monitenna,</hi> who brought him to <hi>Clorineta.</hi> Where he fell a fuming and fretting againſt her, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put the Change upon him, which ſhe excus'd as well as ſhe could, telling him moreover, that that was not a time to clear doubts in, and that ſhe would give him full ſatisfaction after the Ball;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62018:188"/>mean time ſhe was in a peck of troubles to get to the Aſſignation which <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had given her preſently after the Ball, ſhe thought that he would not let his Eye go off of her, and that if ſhe ſhould offer to ſpeak to <hi>Cha-abas</hi> to put off the Aſſignation to another time, for ſome important Reaſons, that would but exaſperate <hi>Repſet</hi> the more, ſo that ſhe did not know what to do, but was wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome ſudden diſorder, or accident which might give her the opportunity of ſtealing away; when that <hi>Monitenna</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd a Note to the Emperour, which intimated, that his two late Miſtreſſes were both enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd at that very moment by two <hi>Mufti's,</hi> whoſe Names ſhe conceal'd, and at the ſame time having given the two <hi>Mufti's</hi> Notes, which gave them notice, that they were diſcover'd, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62018:188"/>that a Friend of theirs had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them a Coach, to make their eſcape, to which they ſhould be guided. Both the <hi>Mufties</hi> ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to one another, broke off abruptly their Courtſhip, and with all the haſte they could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, made towards the door of the Hall, they were met there with two Perſons whom <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenna</hi> had poſted on purpoſe, who told them, taking them aſide into a little Room, that they had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to let no body go by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they firſt depoſited their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, that there being ſome Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els loſt in the Company, it was ſuſpected that ſome Rogues or other had taken this opportunity of pilfering ſomething in ſo great an Aſſembly. The two <hi>Mufties,</hi> half dead at theſe News, offer'd to be ſearch'd, and would have given all the money they had about them, ſo they would but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62018:189"/>let them go in their Diſguiſes, proteſting of their innocence; to which the two men anſwer'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Qew, that they believ'd them far from the Theft by their free offering to be ſearcht, but becauſe that it was the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's particular Order, and that it would be as much as their lives were worth to tranſgreſs it, they plainly told them, that they could not anſwer their deſires: Thus were the two <hi>Mufties</hi> forc'd to uncaſe, fearing a worſe diſaſter, ſhould they ſtay any longer. But how great was their ſurprize, when they knew one another, how they ſtar'd, how their Countenances chang'd, and with what confuſion they were ſeiz'd, there was no time to loſe, they deſired to be conducted to the Coach, which was accordingly done. They both got into the Hackney Coach in the dark, the Coachman asked where
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62018:189"/>they would go; they made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, towards their Lodgings, and told him where they were, they being not far from one another. When they were got out of the crowd and confuſion of Coaches and Lights that were waiting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that part of the Court; The one ſaid to the other, <hi>Is this your Phyſick that you would take? And is this your Country-journey?</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the other. <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, <hi>I have ſome Reaſons for what I have done. And I alſo,</hi> reply'd Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſe; <hi>wherefore it will be beſt for us to wave any further Diſcourſe for the preſent; we are near our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>let us go to reſt, and to morrow, if you pleaſe, about twelve, we will confer Notes, in my Chamber, and endeavour to find out how we have been betray'd, and what</hi> Cha-abas <hi>thoughts are of us.</hi> With that they took leave of one another, and retired each to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62018:190"/>their Appartment. Where we will leave them, to return to our Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> upon the Information, going to give Orders for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſecuring of the two <hi>Mufties</hi> without noiſe, paſs'd by <hi>Clorineta,</hi> who taking him by the Hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-joy'd that <hi>Repſet</hi> was gone, ſaid, that the hour of the Aſſignation drew near; <hi>I will but ſtep to give ſome Orders,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and I am yours.</hi> With that he went from her, ſhe was preſently ſupply'd with ſome other, as well as was the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who not knowing of the Diſcovery which had been made, was wondring at her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant's ſudden departure, after ſo many proteſtations of Love, which he had made her, tho' he would never let her know who he was, notwithſtanding that ſhe had preſs'd him much to it; ſhe had made him very fair returns to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62018:190"/>all his proteſtations, and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him an Aſſignation the next Evening in a certain Walk of the Garden, where he had aſſur'd her he would not fail to be, tho' ſhe deſign'd to put the Change upon him, in ſending <hi>Clorineta</hi> in her room, and ſhe did long till the hour came, that ſhe might learn the ſucceſs of the Cheat. <hi>Cha-abas</hi> being return'd, and the Company growing weary, the Ball broke up, the ſooner too, that he might meet his Miſtreſs at the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. <hi>Clorineta</hi> preſently ſlipp'd out of the way, for fear the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> ſhould take her home with her, and ſo diſappoint the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; the earneſt haſte which <hi>Clorineta</hi> made, and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions which ſhe diſcover'd at her going off, for fear the <hi>Sultana</hi> ſhould ſee her, gave farther ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions to <hi>Monitenna,</hi> that it was an Aſſignation betwixt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62018:191"/>and <hi>Clorineta.</hi> She therefore follow'd her cloſe, and bid one of thoſe Perſons, which ſhe had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd before about the <hi>Mufties,</hi> to dodge that Perſon, and to bring her word in the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Coach where ſhe was gone; ſhe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return'd to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who knew her, that ask'd her what was become of <hi>Cloreneta,</hi> ſhe told her that ſhe knew not. <hi>'Tis no matter, now I have you to keep me company home,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Sultana, it may be ſhe will be at home before us. How ſhall we get home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known? I wiſh we had a Hackney Coach,</hi> continu'd the <hi>Sultana. Your own will do as well, Madam,</hi> reply'd Monitenna; <hi>for no body will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that you would make uſe of it your ſelf.</hi> With the like Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they got to the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Coach, which they caus'd to drive a little out of the Crowd; by this time the Perſon that <hi>Monitenna</hi> had ſent,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62018:191"/>was return'd, who having told her that <hi>Clorineta</hi> was in ſuch a certain place walking all alone, the <hi>Sultana</hi> propos'd going there to take her up, wondring what ſhe ſhould do in ſuch a retired place by her ſelf. They had much to do to diſingage themſelves from the confuſion and concourſe of people; they were ſo long about it, that when they were come to the place of <hi>Clorineta</hi>'s Rendez-vous with <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> they found them both together. This was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Monitenna</hi>'s Heart's deſire: She made no queſtion, but that that Object would create ſtrange Jealouſies in the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Mind, if ſhe had but one grain of Love; and of truth ſhe could not forbear giving ſome touches of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments both to <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> and to <hi>Clorineta.</hi> She told him, that he had not deceiv'd her in her expectations; That ſhe had ſet no
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62018:192"/>greater value on his Proteſtations than ſhe now did ſee them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount unto, and that ſhe look'd on all that he had ſaid as Words ſpoken in the Air.</p>
                  <p>She ſpoke to <hi>Cha-abas</hi> all the while, as if they knew not one another, and ſerv'd <hi>Clorineta</hi> in the ſame manner. But after all, ſhe left <hi>Cha-abas</hi> and <hi>Clorineta</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and retir'd with <hi>Moniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to her Coach, which was in the Street, not permitting either of them to ſtir one ſtep after her, which was no ſmall Affliction to <hi>Monitenna,</hi> who by that ſaw her ſelf fruſtrate of the Deſign which ſhe had of diſappointing them. They ſtaid not long after; They reflected a little on the Diſcovery, and how they had been ſurpriz'd: They fram'd ſome ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, as that it was to deſire <hi>Clorineta</hi> to ſolicite the <hi>Sultana</hi> in <hi>Cha-abas</hi> behalf, and to inform
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62018:192"/>him, how his Declaration of Love had been receiv'd and reſented; all which he had not had time to do, by reaſon of the ſudden break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Ball. Of truth it had laſted longer, but that the Company perceiving the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who was very well known, to go out ſo haſtily, they thought that it was in order to retire, which gave the occaſion of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſome time ſooner than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe might have been expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After this they parted, that by <hi>Clorineta</hi>'s ſudden return home after the <hi>Sultana,</hi> it might take off all occaſion of ſuſpicion; and <hi>Cha-abas</hi> retir'd, to give a full ſwing unto his Amorous Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monitenna</hi> was very well pleas'd at <hi>Clorineta</hi>'s coming Home ſo ſoon after them, and gather'd from it, that no Action had paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Emperour and her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; and when that <hi>Clorineta</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62018:193"/>the <hi>Sultana,</hi> whom ſhe ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on the Aſſignation, that there was no other Deſign in it, but for <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>abas</hi> to gain her to be his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor in his Amours towards the <hi>Sultana,</hi> and to be inform'd by her how his Declaration of Love had been receiv'd by her, ſhe found her ſelf quite at eaſe on that ſide. The <hi>Sultana</hi> ſaid to <hi>Clorineta,</hi> That ſhe had perceiv'd a Paper which was conceal'd in that Heart which had been given her by the little <hi>Cupid,</hi> but that ſhe had not had the Curioſity yet to ſee what it contain'd; with that, taking out of her Pocket both the Heart and the folded Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, after they had admired the Richneſs and neat Contrivance of the Heart, the <hi>Sultana</hi> gave the Paper to <hi>Clorineta</hi> to read. That Freeneſs did abundantly ſpeak the great Conſidence which the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> repos'd in <hi>Clorineta,</hi> and in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitenna</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:62018:193"/>alſo; for in ſuch Caſes but few Women will admit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; but ſuch was the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Love to <hi>Clorineta,</hi> and indifferency for all men but <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> that ſhe ſet no Value upon any thing elſe. This is what was writ in that Paper:</p>

Pray oblige me ſo much,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Sultana, that I may puniſh them accordingly; for I will never endure ſuch near my Perſon. To take all ſuſpicions from off my ſelf, Madam, I am the more earneſt to tell you, that Yeſterday Morning I perceiv'd one of thoſe Gentlemen
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62018:196"/>which</hi> Cha-abas <hi>uſes to employ in ſecret Meſſages and Intrigues, very earneſt in Diſcourſe with one of the</hi> Tailor<hi>'s Servants, in the paſſage that leads to the place appointed for their Workroom, where I did ſee him give the Fellow Money for ſomething which he had convey'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand.

I am ſatisfy'd,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Sultana, and believe it to be ſo; and ſince it is none of my own Servants that has been prevail'd with, I'le trouble my ſelf no further about it; all

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62018:200"/>Subjects were. But others that had Courage enough to expect a good ſucceſs from their Arms, and the Juſtice of their Cauſe, being clearly convinc'd, that the War they were going to make through their oppoſition of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> was directly againſt the deſigns of <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> in which their late Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had no Concern at all. They took up Arms, gather'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, made themſelves Maſters of ſome ſtrong Holds, which they fortified, got in Proviſions againſt a Siege, and declar'd one and all, that they would ſtand by one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to the laſt drop of their blood.</p>
                  <p>The little or no reſiſtance which <hi>Amurat</hi> had found at his Landing, and ſome time after, did ſo raiſe the Hearts of all the <hi>Haliſts</hi> in all his Dominions, that the Fortreſs of <hi>Blunid</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Clonſtade,</hi> whoſe Governour had required
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62018:200"/>time to deliver it up, did ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſe to perform his promiſe; on the contrary, being in hopes of ſome Relief, he fortify'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it, and bid defiance unto the Senate of that Kingdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, That he would never part with it, but to <hi>Amurat,</hi> who had plac'd him in there, and for whom he would preſerve it to the laſt extremity; and divers <hi>Haliſts</hi> did arm themſelves ſecretly, and did aſſociate together in ſmall Troops, in hopes of being reinforc'd by <hi>Amurat</hi> from <hi>Leridan,</hi> ſo ſoon as he ſhould have reduc'd that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which they expected he would do in a very ſhort time. News were alſo ſent over into <hi>Albania,</hi> that <hi>Amurat,</hi> with ſome of his Friends <hi>Haliſt,</hi> and a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army of <hi>Perſians</hi> was landed in <hi>Leridan,</hi> had ſubdued his Enemies, recover'd that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, baniſh'd from thence all <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:62018:201"/>and was going with all expedition to do the like in the Kingdom of <hi>Clonſtad,</hi> from whence he would march to them with a Triumphant Army, and reſtore all his Friends the <hi>Haliſts</hi> to their Eſtates and Employs, deſtroy wholly the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, baniſh all its Abettors, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh there the Religion of <hi>Hali:</hi> they went ſo far as to prefix a time for <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Return, and in all their Diſcourſes, their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in their very Looks, they expreſs'd as much confidence and aſſurance as could be imagin'd, that all this would infallibly come to paſs.</p>
                  <p>Mean time the Grand Senate of the Empire was continually in Conſultation how to ſecure the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, the Laws of the Land, the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the whole Empire from the <hi>Perſians</hi> Uſurpation, and all
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62018:201"/>the Conſpiracies of the <hi>Haliſts;</hi> they order'd, amongſt other things, that all <hi>Haliſts</hi> ſhould depart at ten miles diſtance from the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of the Empire, but they were ſo puff'd up with the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of their ſudden delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they minded it not, and but very few, and them of the moſt timid amongſt them, did obſerve thoſe Orders. On the other hand, the Confederate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, againſt <hi>Cha-abas</hi> unſufferable Pride and Ambition, did daily gain Victories againſt his Forces, who were forc'd to retreat, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all that they had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their former Treaties and Engagements, but it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing all the Violences and Cruelties imaginable, there was nothing to be ſeen but Fires, Ruines, Deſolations, Rapes, Thefts, and Murders in all places that they quitted, not ſo much as ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62018:202"/>of Moſquees, nor the Palaces of Princes, and other publick Buildings, which amongſt all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ever preſerv'd between the moſt implacable and invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enemies.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Cha-abas</hi> call'd the Heathens to come and make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions with their Arms in the Territories of the Confederate Princes, aſſuring them, that they might do what they pleas'd againſt them, whilſt he would buy off their other Enemies, and with his whole Power keep them in play to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Frontiers. Thus did that great Pretender of the Extirpation of Hereſies, and of the ſetting up of <hi>Hali</hi>'s Religion, cauſe the ſworn Enemies of the true <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, to deſtroy with Fire and Sword thoſe who profeſt his own Religion, which plainly ſhew'd, that Religion was only a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence he made uſe of, to uſurp the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62018:202"/>Rights of others, and to render himſelf abſolute Monarch over all that part of the World; a thing which he had long ſince deſign'd, and divers times attempted, and for which now all thoſe Confederate Princes of his own Religion, and others of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion had unanimouſly agreed to call him to an account, not doubting but that the Great <hi>Ala,</hi> who knew all his Treacheries, and perfidious Dealings, and Uſurpations would bleſs their Arms and Undertakings, in ſo juſt a Cauſe, againſt that common Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Things were in this poſture, when that <hi>Cha-abas</hi> having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Love for a time to triumph over his inſatiated Ambition, was laying cloſe Siege unto the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Chaſtity. He dreſs'd himſelf with all the advantages that he could poſſible, to pleaſe her Eye; he fram'd the moſt pathetick Speeches
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62018:203"/>that he could invent, to charm her Ears; he made her the richeſt Preſents that he could poſſible do, to pleaſe her Pridè and Ambition, and he expreſs'd as great Paſſions and tranſports of Love, to gain ſome returns of the ſame Nature from her. He ſent one of thoſe Mercuries, which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, to know of the <hi>Sultana,</hi> when he ſhould have the Honour to wait on her, and receive her Commands, and at the ſame time privately to convey into <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta</hi>'s Hands a little Note, in which he expreſs'd the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rather increaſe of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and put her in mind of the Aſſignation which ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to make him. This Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was receiv'd by the <hi>Sultana</hi> with that courteous and affable diſpoſition with which ſhe charm'd all Perſons that approach'd her Preſence, and bid him tell the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62018:203"/>that no Laws were to be preſcrib'd him in his own Empire, where it was but too much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for every one to obey eſpecially, by a poor dejected Princeſs, who had refug'd her ſelf under the Wings of his generous Protection, but that ſhe ſhould be better diſpoſed and more fitted to receive ſo great an honour, with that reſpect which ſhe ought to ſhew to ſo great and glorious a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, about the Evening, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do her ſo great an honour, and ſo diſmiſs'd the Meſſenger with Civility; who having finiſh'd his buſineſs in publick with the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi> made a Complement to <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineta,</hi> who had been preſent at the delivery of his Meſſage to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> and who had remain'd behind, when the <hi>Sultana</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, to know whether <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had retain'd any thoughts of her. The Mercury ſoon found an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62018:204"/>of ſecretly conveying the amorous Note into <hi>Clorineta</hi>'s hand, who greedily receiving it, told him, that ſhe would take the firſt opportunity that ſhe could poſſible to read privately the Contents, and that according as it required, ſhe would ſend an Anſwer by an expreſs Meſſenger. With that the Meſſenger went his ways, as having finiſhed the buſineſs he was came about, and returned to give <hi>Cha-abas</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Embaſſy.</p>

                     <hi>Monitenna</hi> with a Rival's look, than whoſe Eyes none are more piercing, had obſerv'd the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Note, the earneſtneſs with which <hi>Clorineta</hi> had ſeis'd it, and the care with which ſhe had conveyed it into her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, all this increas'd her rage and whetted her revenge; ſhe did not abandon her Rival one moment all that Day, endear'd
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62018:204"/>her ſelf as much as ſhe could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her, and ſeeing her in a penſive humour, ask'd her what ſhe ailed, and whether ſhe could aſſiſt her in any thing, and do her ſervice?

Let us get in ſome private place, my Dear, added ſhe, while the <hi>Sultana</hi> is retir'd, according to her daily cuſtom obout this time, and there I'll lay open my Heart to thee, in hopes that thou wilt be my faithful Friend and Counſellor; with that taking <hi>Monitenna</hi> by the hand, ſhe led her into her own Appartment.</p>
                  <p>When they were got privately together, here ſaid <hi>Clorineta,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Note to <hi>Monitenna,</hi> read

Well, my Will is good, I could venture on in giving the Emperour an Aſſignation, if I could tell where conveniently, and that I could conceal it from the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s knowledge; <hi>Where do you think would be the moſt convenient place,</hi> continu'd ſhe? <hi>None like one of the Pavillions in the Garden,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Monitenna, after every body is retir'd; there you may have all the freedom imaginable of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining one another. You ſay right,</hi> reply'd <hi>Clarineta; but ſhould</hi> Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet <hi>at that time come to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, all hours being alike to him, and he not find me there, nor at the</hi> Sultana<hi>'s, what noiſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance would he not make in his Jealouſie? I know not,</hi> anſwer'd Monitenna, <hi>except you ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62018:207"/>you were gone ill to Bed, and had given out, that you would not be diſturbed by any Perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. I believe that might do,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd Clorineta, <hi>if you would be ſo kind as to give him his Anſwer, I ſhould do a great deal more for you,</hi> reply'd Monitenna, <hi>than that comes to; Then will I go write the Aſſignation for this Night,</hi> ſaid Clorineta, <hi>and give it to</hi> Cha-abas <hi>when he comes by and by to viſit the</hi> Sultana, <hi>and then I will diſpoſe my ſelf to go meet him at the place and time appointed, which, I believe, will be moſt proper betwixt eleven and twelve, for the</hi> Sultana <hi>retires not till eleven, beſides the</hi> Mufti <hi>ſeldome comes to me after eleven: I ſhall rely upon you,</hi> continu'd ſhe, <hi>to manage the</hi> Mufti, <hi>in caſe he ſhould drop in at ſuch an unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time. Fear me not,</hi> reply'd Monitenna, <hi>as to my part with the</hi> Mufti. With that <hi>Clorineta</hi> ſetled
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62018:207"/>her ſelf to writing the Note, and <hi>Monitenna</hi> went out, leaving her very buſie about it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Make no queſtion but it will be thought ill of</hi> Monitenna<hi>'s play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing double with</hi> Clorineta, <hi>but thoſe Cenſurers little know what liberty is taken of that Nature, amongſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals in Love, if that we daily ſee, that in Ambition, which is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion leſs blind than that of Love, notwithſtanding how Friends, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Brothers and Siſters, Fathers and Children, nay even Wives and Miſtreſſes, are ſacrific'd to the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of that devouring Paſſion; How much more cruelty may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a Rival in Love? Yet in all that</hi> Monitenna <hi>acts, there is no mixture of cruelty, there is barely the ſatisfaction of Revenge on an imperious Rival, who is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent as to lay her ſelf open to a Perſon, of whom common Fame ſpoke ſome Intelligence with the Emperour,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62018:208"/>which could not have ſcap'd</hi> Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta<hi>'s Ears; beſides, ſhe did but break her meaſures, as to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying part, and made her ſelf ſport with raiſing of Jealouſie in the</hi> Mufti Repſet<hi>'s boſom towards her Rival, of truth it was too much Vanity in</hi> Clorineta <hi>to think her Beauty ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to exclude all other Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from their ſhare in</hi> Cha-abas <hi>Affections. She might have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that</hi> Monitenna<hi>'s aſſiduous Services and Cares to</hi> Cha-abas, <hi>during his late Diſtemper, might claim as great a ſhare in his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as her own Beauty could do; and ſhe ought not to have believ'd all that a Rival may ſay againſt her ſelf in ſuch a caſe, but rather have diſtruſted that there lay ſome Train hid under that deſign to blow her up with, when opportunity ſhould ſerve; wherefore ſhe was but juſtly puniſht for her imprudence, and want of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection.</hi>

                  <p>Now I come to the two <hi>Mufties, Repſet</hi> had been at <hi>Chilaſe</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where after divers Diſcourſes, they were ſo well agreed together, that they had made a reſolution to go hand in hand with their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, with aſſurances of aſſiſting one another; as to <hi>Repſet,</hi> his Court was already made, he wanted but a Promiſe from his Rival not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon his Prerogative at any time, now, or hereafter, in caſe he ſhould come ſhort of his Deſigns with the <hi>Sultana,</hi> which had been ſolemnly ſworn to him, but with what reſolution to be kept by him, I know not; for it is a Maxim, That all Rivals are to be adjudg'd Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in Love, and no body is bound to keep their Faith to Hereticks, according to the bleſſed Doctrine of the Order of the Mahometiſts. <hi>Repſet</hi> was ſatisfied with his <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta,</hi> and <hi>Chilaſe</hi> had writ a Letter to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> to intreat of her the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62018:209"/>favour which ſhe had promiſs'd at the making of an Aſſignation, which Letter <hi>Repſet</hi> had engag'd <hi>Clorineta</hi> ſhould deliver to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> without knowing from whence it came. Upon theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of Friendſhip one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they had parted, but could never find out, nor ſo much as come near ſuſpecting of the true Perſon that had given them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their being diſcover'd, and hearing no more of it, they reſted very well contented, not queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but that they ſhould have heard more of it e're then, if there had been any further deſign in it, than giving them a falſe Alarm. The Emperour, 'tis true, had made ſome reflexions on the Confidence of the two <hi>Mufties</hi> his Rivals, which at firſt had put him upon a further ſearch into the buſineſs, to have known their Names; but not knowing to whom to addreſs
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62018:209"/>himſelf for further intelligence, and on the other hand, being reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in his new Amours, this laſt had put out of his mind all thoughts of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monitenna</hi> thought ſhe had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence ſufficient from her Rival, to give her the opportunity to ſerve her a Trick, and all under one to ſerve her own turn; ſhe writ a Letter in a ſtrange Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to <hi>Repſet,</hi> which ſhe caus'd to be convey'd to him by a ſtrange Hand, in which ſhe gave him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that if he would prevent <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineta</hi> from going to an Aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Night at eleven of the Clock, which ſhe had given to a Rival of his, he would do well to come to her about ten of the Clock that Evening, and not to ſtir from her till the Hour was over, that he ſhould be convinc'd of the reality of the buſineſs by the uneaſineſs and reſtleſneſs that he ſhould find her in, and that if
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62018:210"/>he let her know that he had had ſome Intelligence of her Deſigns, it would diſenable the Informer from ever more doing him ſuch another piece of Service. The <hi>Mufti</hi> did receive the Note, and promis'd to himſelf to be with his Miſtreſs early enough to ſpoil her Sport for that time, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her exactly.</p>
                  <p>At laſt the Hour was come, in which <hi>Cha-abas</hi> was to make his Viſit to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> he was dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the greateſt advantage ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and had prepar'd himſelf to ſpeak his mind throughly to her, and to learn from her mouth what he might expect of return: He enters the <hi>Sultana's</hi> Chamber, ſhe who was reſolv'd to give him a poſitive Anſwer, goes to meet him; <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays Cha-abas, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming upon that Goodneſs which I believe to be in you in as great a Splendour, as all the reſt of your
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62018:210"/>Perfections, I come to lay my life at your feet, expecting from your breath my Sentence to live or die.</hi> With that he put one knee on the ſloor. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him again, making an offer to raiſe him, <hi>If your life or death were at my diſpoſal, you might be ſure to be abſolute Maſter of both, for I ſhould inſtantly reſign unto you that Power ſo juſtly due to you alone under the Heavens. Live, Great Sir,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſhe, <hi>live to reflect on the unworthineſs of that Perſon, in whoſe power you would depoſite ſo great a Treaſure. 'Las! what is life, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> anſwer'd Cha-abas, <hi>if it is not bleſs'd with your allowance; and who can ſee you, and not deſire above life, above all, to have a ſhare in your Affections? No, Madam, it is far better to die than to live, and not have ſome hopes of being one day bleſs'd with your Love: The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens that have made you ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62018:211"/>ſo charming, ſo much to be belov'd by all that ſee you with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, cannot have made you ſo cruel, as to take no better advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all your Perfections, than to ſtrike Admiration and Love in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and then to let them periſh in their Love, without the leaſt grain of pity or commiſeration, for thoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which your Beauty does occaſion. The ſame Heavens, Great Sir,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the <hi>Sultana, have deſign'd me from the very beginning for</hi> Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, <hi>I have given him all that he had Right to claim of me, and I have left nothing at my own diſpoſal, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that I had no body elſe to pleaſe or gratifie but him. You ſee, Sir, that by that gift I am no more my own, and that if you require any thing from me beyond that Reſpect and Honour which I ought to have for the greateſt Prince of the World, it is to</hi> Amurat, <hi>and not to me, that you ought to addreſs your ſelf: I
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62018:211"/>now do but keep for him, and wear about me for his uſe, whatever I once could call my own. Yet, Madam,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Emperor, <hi>ſome pity may be allow'd unto the miſerable, and</hi> Amurat <hi>be no Loſer by it; you may command my Empire, I will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately beg on my bare knees a Peace from my Enemies, and bend inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all my Forces againſt his Enemies, if you but conſent to it, nay I will head them my ſelf, and lead them on through the thickeſt of your Rebels, if my Services may be but receiv'd. I will not only receive your Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> anſwer'd the <hi>Sultana, but your Commands alſo, if I can be ſo happy as to oblige you in either, Sir, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out too great a force on my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and here I declare, Sir, that next to</hi> Amurat, <hi>you may claim the greateſt ſhare in my Eſteem and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. That is no more yet,</hi> reply'd the Emperour, <hi>than what you would mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly allow to any perſon that would
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62018:212"/>but in the leaſt meaſure deſerve it, and beg it of you, but not one grain of Love, Madam. Yes, Sir,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Sultana, I love, nay I adore your Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and amongſt them that Noble Zeal, which has made you not to ſpare your own Subjects, but ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd them to your juſt reſentments, in their diſobedience of your Commands, to abandon their Heretical Religion to cleave to yours: But as to Love, beſides, Sir, that my natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and diſpoſition lead me quite another way, whether through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of body, or prepoſſeſſion of mind by other more powerful motives, I find at this preſent, that it will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill anſwer the condition that both</hi> Amurat <hi>and I am in, and the ſad circumſtances that we groan under, which are Cauſes that ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce care, ſorrow, and fretfulneſs, rather than Love and a gay Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. In a word, Sir, your Perſon is moſt acceptable, your Wit, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62018:212"/>Courteſie, Obligingneſs, and all other Ornaments are without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and worthy to be admir'd by all the World. They may, nay they do ſtir up an admiration and high eſteem for you in all perſons, that are capable to judge of your Excellencies; but you muſt excuſe me, if they cannot incite Love in a Boſom that is not capable of any. The more miſerable Wretch I am, Madam, and peradventure it is that I am come too late,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>after ſome more happy Rival; and</hi>— he was going on, when the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> thus interrupted him; <hi>Sir, whenever you ſee, or are by any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance imaginable, convinc'd of my yielding to another what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no Monarch in the World would better merit than your ſelf, except the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Emperour; do not then only tax me with all the Evils that could taint a virtuous Soul, but loath and deteſt me as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62018:213"/>the worſt of my Sex; but till then let me humbly beg of you to harbour a better opinion of me, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I have for you all the reſpect, honour, and eſteem that can be produc'd in a generous and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spirit, by all the Endearments, and all the rare Qualities and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that can be imagin'd. Well, Madam, I will not inſiſt any longer,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>on a buſineſs that is not pleaſing to your Ears, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſpecially, but will live in hopes, that by my moſt aſſiduous Services, my indefatigable diligence and my matchleſs Love, I ſhall in time produce in you that Love which you will not own to have, which I ſo paſſionately deſire to find in your Boſom, and without which I ſhall ever remain the moſt miſerable Prince in the World.</hi> He had much to do to get time to end theſe words, by reaſon of Company, which he ſaw at diſtance coming
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62018:213"/>to viſit the <hi>Sultana,</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her alſo from giving him any other Anſwer, than, <hi>Well, Sir, agreed, let us leave all to time.</hi> With that the <hi>Sultana</hi> aroſe, and receiv'd the Company, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd an agreeable Diverſion, in which <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had a part, tho' not long; for his repulſe by the <hi>Sultana</hi> did but whet him the more in his application to <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta,</hi> to whom he gave the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to convey her thoughts in writing to him, and ſtay'd not long after, that he might not give the leaſt ſuſpicion that could be to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> and to gratifie his amorous Curioſity and deſires, which rendred him very impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to learn the ſucceſs of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours with that Miſtreſs, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired then, and read in that Note what follows.</p>

I ſay, that if I was in your caſe,</hi> reply'd Monitenna, <hi>I would reſolve to ſend ſome perſon to him, with ſome great excuſe, which ſhould expreſs the ſorrow that you are in for the diſappointment: Well, I think I muſt do ſo, and if you would take that trouble upon you, for I have no body elſe that I durſt confide in, you will infinitely oblige me, he will not know you in the dark, tell him that—tell him what you pleaſe; your mind being leſs troubled than mine is at preſent, you may better frame an excuſe than I can my ſelf. Pray loſe no time, remember the Nature of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and act accordingly in it, I will go to Bed, which in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and diſturbance of mind I am in, is the fitteſt place for me, ſince I cannot go where I would, you
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62018:218"/>may ſafely ſay, it was a ſudden Fit of Sickneſs ſurpriz'd me; and I believe that it will be ſo in earneſt by morning. I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you any longer; I will retire.</hi> With that ſhe prepar'd her ſelf for Bed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monitenna</hi> was raviſh'd to ſee her Plots ſucceed ſo well; ſhe knowing before hand to what ſhe ſhould bring that buſineſs, had dreſs'd her ſelf to all the advantage ſhe could poſſible, and wanted but ſome little addition to her Head, to fit her to perſonate <hi>Clorineta,</hi> with the Emperour, as ſhe had projected to do. She made all the haſte i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable to fit her ſelf to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhe was going about, and ſet forth for the Adventure: She came into the Garden by the help of the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Key, which <hi>Clorineta</hi> had ſecur'd before hand for her purpoſe, and addreſs'd her ſteps to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villion, where ſhe was not long
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62018:219"/>before <hi>Cha-abas</hi> came. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently run to her, and flung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about her Neck with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tranſport imaginable. <hi>And is Fortune ſo kind at laſt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>as to bring me into the Arms of that Perſon that I ſo much prize above the World? Monitenna,</hi> who all this while had not had time to ſpeak, reply'd, <hi>You miſtake the Perſon, Sir, I believe, and forget who you were to meet. Not in the leaſt, dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> reply'd Cha-abas, <hi>I know that the</hi> Sultana <hi>is at this time retir'd to divert her ſelf with her ſullen Humour, and that I have now the happineſs to poſſeſs that towards which my Heart has the greateſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, there being more of Gallantry and Reſpect in its application to the</hi> Sultana, <hi>than Love, which I bring intirely to the moſt charming</hi> Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta. <hi>Still you may miſtake, Sir,</hi> ſaid <hi>Monitenna, for I find you ſpake not thoſe things which you intend to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62018:219"/>me; and I fear very much that your Heart and your Tongue go not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Think, Sir, better before you ſpeak, and go not on ſo faſt to ruin a poor credulous creature that has but too much truſted in your fair Words: I am not the firſt, it may be, that has been too credulous, and I believe would wiſh themſelves now in my place. But few, Madam, can pretend to that Happineſs, I aſſure you,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>and none to ſuch a ſhare in my Love as my dear</hi> Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta. <hi>Yes, you will except</hi> Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenna, <hi>doubtleſs,</hi> reply'd Moniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. Monitenna, reply'd the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, in a ſcornful Tone! <hi>Alas, poor creature, ſhe has deſerv'd much, I muſt confeſs, by her aſſiduous care in my late illneſs, and I have, and will ſtill more reward her for her dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which I muſt confeſs was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; but—But ſhe loves you, I dare ſay,</hi> reply'd <hi>Monitenna</hi> haſtily; <hi>and it was that Love of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62018:220"/>hers which made her do for you what you might not expect from any other Perſon that had not been mov'd by Love: And doubtleſs you have given her ſome hopes of Return in the ſame Nature, or—</hi> There <hi>Cha-abas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted her in his turn, ſaying, <hi>I might encourage her, 'tis likely, with ſome ſuch hopes, to continue her in the ſame Humour of aſſiſting me as ſhe had done: But what is that to Love? Nay, what is that to you, to me, to our preſent concerns, dear Madam? Let us loſe no longer time in things that ſo little concern our preſent buſineſs; let us enjoy our ſelves while we may—</hi>Saying of this he began to be a little more buſie with his Hands than he had been; but finding that there was no Reply, nor ſo much as the leaſt reſiſtance made, that the Lady was fallen forwards on him, her Arms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended downwards, and without Motion, it made him deſiſt from
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62018:220"/>the Labour of his Hands, to look after her: He lifted her up, which motion bringing poor <hi>Monitenna</hi> to her ſelf again from the Swoon that his Cruel Expreſſions had put her in: <hi>Oh! cruel Prince,</hi> ſaid ſhe, giving a great ſigh, <hi>and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate</hi> Monitenna! With that ſhe return'd into a fainting Fit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which gave time to <hi>Cha-abas</hi> to conſider more exactly who it was, by the aid of the Moon, which had riſen ſince their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than he had done before in the dark. He ſaw plainly his miſtake, and was doubtleſs troubled at what he had done; but he was no leſs ſtruck with wonder at <hi>Monitenna</hi>'s ſupplying of <hi>Clorineta</hi>'s Room: He did all he could to bring her to life again; He laid her down on the Seats that were in the place, and run to the Fountain that was not far, and brought from thence Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his Hat, which he flung in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62018:221"/>her Face: At laſt he did ſo much, that the poor afflicted <hi>Monitenna</hi> came to her ſelf again, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deep ſigh, and looking ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly on the Emperour, <hi>Oh! do not, Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>take ſo much pains on a Perſon that is ſo unworthy of it; Reſerve thoſe Labours for more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Perſons: And ſince that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable</hi> Monitenna <hi>has no hopes left of obtaining the Effects of thoſe vain Promiſes in which ſhe ſo unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put too much confidence: Be not ſo doubly cruel, as firſt to kill her, and then not to let her die. My dear</hi> Monitenna, reply'd Cha-abas, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that I have a ſhare of Love for you alſo, and let me intreat you to attibute my Failings to that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that we Men have given our ſelves of courting all New Faces: Sometimes it may be, when we loſe by the change, and are invited to it meerly by Novelty: You know, dear</hi> Monitenna, <hi>that we are Nature's
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62018:221"/>Children, and that we love to follow the ſteps of that dear Mother, who her ſelf is delighted with Variety: I love thee, I proteſt I do, and ſhall give thee further Demonſtrations of it whene're thou pleaſeſt. We are both miſtaken,</hi> continued he, <hi>it is true, I did not think to find thee here; I confeſs that I had appointed to meet the Lady</hi> Clorineta, <hi>but how ſhe has fail'd, and you come in her Room, is a wonder to me. You are miſtaken in her, Sir,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Monitenna,</hi> who was a little come to her ſelf, <hi>ſhe has other Aſſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, other Amours to manage beſides yours; ſhe loves Variety as well as you ſay you do, Sir,</hi> continued ſhe; <hi>and it was the entertaining of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lover, which ſhe prefers to you, that made her deſire me to ſupply her place, and to tell you, that ſome ſudden Diſtemper has been the cauſe of her diſappointing you. And does ſhe prefer any man to me?</hi> reply'd
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62018:222"/>the Emperour in an huffing tone, <hi>Is ſhe ſo weak as to forget who I am? and can ſhe pleaſe her ſelf in any others company better than in mine? Then let her go, I will no longer think her worthy of my thoughts, I will leave her to aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with Perſons more ſuitable to the lowneſs of her mind; ſhe does not merit the Love of a Monarch, that can prefer a meaner Perſon to his Favours. But as for that Perſon who ſhe prefers to me, I will baniſh him out of my Empire; none ſhall find protection in it, that ſhall have dar'd to lift up his thoughts where there might be but the leaſt ſuſpicion imaginable that I deſign'd: Let me but know that inſolent Varlet, and I ſhall ſoon break his meaſures. Great Prince,</hi> reply'd Monitenna, <hi>know that the Perſon is not worth your Anger, no more than ſhe for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mean pitiful</hi> Mufti <hi>before the greateſt Monarch in the World: Let
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62018:222"/>them alone for the preſent, Sir, and I engage to you, that in ſome few days I ſhall not only bring you to ſurpriſe</hi> Clorineta <hi>and her Lover to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but alſo ſhew you another Scene at the ſame time and place, betwixt another</hi> Mufti <hi>and the</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana, <hi>how reſerv'd ſoever ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it towards you. How! ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Mufti, reply'd Cha-abas, as ſurpriſed, <hi>has the Devils ſet looſe all the</hi> Mufties <hi>in the World to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and thwart me in my Amours. Muſt ſo great and mighty a Prince as I am, be baffled in his Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by ſo mean a thing as a</hi> Mufti? <hi>I ſhall make ſuch Examples of them as ſhall for ever deter all ſuch Black Coats from caſting but an Eye on any Object that I deign to favour with my liking: And as to you, my dear</hi> Monitenna, <hi>here is my Hand, that for the future I ſhall have you in greater Eſteem than ever, and you ſhall be ſenſible henceforth both of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62018:223"/>my Bounty and Love: Build upon it, as on a ſure Foundation that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail you. Monitenna</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill very much diſorder'd by her late diſturbance, return'd hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thanks to <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd him, That ſhe would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by all means imaginable to deſerve in part his Favours, though ſhe could never pretend to merit ſo much Honour: She told him moreover, That ſhe fear'd her late Diſorders might bring ſome Fits upon her, which ſhe would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to intercept, if ſhe could come to ſome Remedies which ſhe had in her Cloſet againſt ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. Upon this <hi>Cha-abas</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of her by the Hand, gave her a Kiſs, as a Pledge of what he had promis'd her, and ſaying, That ſeeing ſhe ſtill continu'd ill, he would not detain her any longer from her Reſt, and would put off to another time giving of her
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62018:223"/>more ample Proofs of his Love. With that he led her to the Garden Door which anſwer'd to her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, where, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered, he parted with her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monitenna</hi> was not a little pleas'd with her ſelf for having ſo much diſguſted the Emperour of his Two New Miſtreſſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiated her ſelf into his Favour again: She reſolv'd to manage it, and to gain him wholly to her; wherefore ſhe purſu'd her Deſign, in rendering the <hi>Sultana</hi> and <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta</hi> as ſuſpected to the Emperour as could be, not making any ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at all to undermine thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had inſinuated themſelves into <hi>Cha-abas</hi>'s Affections, to her prejudice, and who, as ſhe thought, had encroached on her Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which ſhe laid claim to by Precedency. She enquir'd at her return after <hi>Clorineta</hi>'s Health; it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62018:224"/>was told her, That ſhe had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd in Bed ever ſince, without Sleep; that the <hi>Mufti</hi> had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſited her, and was ſtill attending in the Withdrawing-Room; and that ſhe had frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ask'd after her, and order'd, that ſhe ſhould be brought to her ſo ſoon as ſhe return'd; that made <hi>Monitenna</hi> to haſten to <hi>Clorineta</hi>'s Chamber, where going to her Bed-ſide, ſhe gave her ſuch an account of her Tranſaction with <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> as ſhe thought fit, to put her nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in extraordinary Hopes or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: She could not ſtay long with her; for the <hi>Mufti,</hi> who had been a whole half hour without ſeeing her, could hold out no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and was demanding admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; So that as <hi>Monitenna</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at one Door, for fear of creating more Jealouſies in his Head, the <hi>Mufti</hi> came in by the other. <hi>Well, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62018:224"/>Clorineta, <hi>how do you find your ſelf now,</hi> taking her by the Arm? <hi>Truly the worſe for you,</hi> replyed ſhe; <hi>for you will not let me ſleep, but are continually diſturbing me when I fall into ſlumbers, which ſtrangely diſcompoſes me. Well, Madam, I hope that you will be ſo juſt, as to attribute it to my care of your health, and my Zeal in your Service: And ſince I find, that there is no increaſe of Fever, now that it is towards day, I will leave you wholly to your reſt, which I ſhall pray may be ſweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to you. I ſhall viſit you again when I think you have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently repos'd, with hopes to find you quite recover'd: mean time, I am your humble Servant.</hi> With that he took his leave of <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta,</hi> and went his way, not doubting but that he had broke the Aſſignation for that time; and he ſet himſelf on thinking how he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62018:225"/>ſhould ſecure her wholly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the future.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> for his part, was ſtrangely alter'd in his Mind, ſince the Information which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitenna</hi> had given him of <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta</hi>'s Plurality of Lovers: She did not concern him ſo much, peradventure, not thinking her any longer worthy of his Eſteem, after the prefering of a <hi>Mufti</hi> to him: But more particularly was he troubled at the Inſolency of that <hi>Mufti,</hi> that durſt aſpire to the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Favour, who he could not beat out of his Head, but 'twas <hi>Repſet;</hi> and not well knowing who the other <hi>Mufti</hi> could be, he was ſtill apt to fall into the Opinion, that it was the ſame Perſon who made Love to both his Miſtreſſes, at the ſame time. This he imprinted ſo well in his Imagination, that nothing could beat it out, no, not his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62018:225"/>on what <hi>Monitenna</hi> had told him, of bringing him to ſurprize both his Rivals at once: He thought that ſhe meant, that he ſhould ſee <hi>Repſet</hi> courting of both his Miſtreſſes preſently after one another; or that he had not well underſtood her: But ſtill his Mind was entirely bent on the belief, that <hi>Repſet</hi> was the only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which he found in his Amours, which made him take the Reſolution to watch him cloſe, to examine all his Actions, every ſtep that he made, and what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he kept all the day long, by ſuch truſty Perſons as ſhould give him full Information of all that he deſired to know; and in that Reſolution to ſet ſome Perſons about it that very day, he went to reſt.</p>
                  <p>Mufti <hi>Chilaſe</hi> having by this time taken all his meaſures and precautions in his further Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62018:226"/>to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> had writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which he did give her a further account of his Perſon: He got a truſty Meſſenger to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it to <hi>Repſet</hi>'s Hands, who had promis'd him to give it to <hi>Clorine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> who ſhould preſent it to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> not knowing from whom it came: So that <hi>Repſet</hi> carried it along with him when he return'd that ſame day to give a Viſit to <hi>Clorineta,</hi> which was towards E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening. After he had entertain'd her a while, he took his leave of her, to go about a Buſineſs of high Concern, intreating her to deliver that Letter which he gave her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s own Hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any enquiry after the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; which ſhe having promis'd to do, he went his way, and ſhe not long after waited on the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi> unto whom having deliver'd that Letter, without a Name, the <hi>Sultana</hi> had the Curioſity to read in it as follows:</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Sultana</hi> was no leſs ſurpris'd at the Preſumption of the Perſon, whom ſhe was inform'd was of low Birth, as ſhe was at the Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Style and Expreſſions: She gueſs'd, that it could not come but from that Perſon who had ſo earneſtly ſolicited her at the Masking, for an Interview, which was quite out of her Mind, as having never deſign'd any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Converſation or Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with any one, beyond the Limits of that Night. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ſee how far this Inſolence would go; wherefore ſhe deſired <hi>Clorineta</hi> to aſſiſt her in it, in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Two Words to that Perſon, in which ſhe ſhould give him notice of a Time and Place for an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, where ſhe her ſelf ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonate

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62018:229"/>that they made towards them with all the Sails they had, as well as the Wind would permit them, and ſome few of their Veſſels fell upon the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the reſt of their Fleet not being able to come up, or at leaſt pretending ſo; for it was ſhrewdly ſuſpected, that ſome <hi>Perſian</hi> Gold had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſome of the Officers, and had ſo infatuated them, as to make them forget to add Bullets to that Powder which they ſhot againſt the <hi>Perſian</hi> Fleet.

They retired on their own Coaſts, and into their own Harbours: The Seas were extreamly peſter'd with <hi>Perſian</hi> Privateers, which would do miſchief to ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Merchant Men; and on
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62018:229"/>both ſides there were daily ſome Veſſels taken.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Repſet</hi> was agitated betwixt two troubleſom Paſſions, Envy and Jealouſie, which made him take the reſolution to ſpoil <hi>Chilaſe</hi>'s Sport; ſometimes he was raging mad with Envy, to think that after all he had done towards the <hi>Sultana,</hi> to get to that paſs, which <hi>Chilaſe</hi> had ſo eaſily attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, all to no effect, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſs in another he could not brook; another time, he fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Writing to be <hi>Clorineta</hi>'s, that ſtirr'd up Jealouſie in him, believing that the <hi>Sultana</hi> deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Addreſs, <hi>Clorineta</hi> had been glad to take the opportunity of her refuſe, to perſonate her,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62018:235"/>and to enjoy that which the other ſlighted; eitherwiſe did put him upon miſchief, which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to act with a witneſs. To that purpoſe, when it drew near the hour of the Aſſignation, he under-hand enquired, whether the <hi>Sultana</hi> did deſign to ſtir out that Evening? And he had Intelligence that ſhe was indiſpos'd, and had been all the day, and deſign'd to go to her Bed; that information, cur'd him of his Envy; but then it increas'd his Jealouſie, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now but that <hi>Clorineta</hi> had a mind to know whether all <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> were alike, the rather too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had been inform'd, that <hi>Clorineta</hi> had declar'd ſhe would go forth that Evening. He made no more noiſe about it, but went immediately to the Gardiner, and for a little money, got from him the Keys of thoſe Cocks which made all the Water-works play
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62018:235"/>that were in and about the <hi>Grotto,</hi> and prepared to get privately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the place of the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a little before the hour.</p>
                  <p>All things being thus got ready on all ſides, <hi>Repſet</hi> came firſt to the <hi>Grotto,</hi> where he hid himſelf, as well as he could, under one of the Seats that was neareſt to the Cock. That Night prov'd very dark, which contributed much to his concealment; this was about half an hour before the prefixt time.

There was no body that frequented the Garden that could loſe their way to the <hi>Grotto,</hi> all the Walks in it leading to it, which was in the middle of the furtheſt Square of the Garden; but he went on very ſlowly, his Heart failing him, and propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ill at hand, nay, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failing Prognoſtick amongſt the Superſtitious happening alſo, (bleeding at the Noſe) he was upon the very point of giving over his Deſign, and of making an honourable Retreat. This laſt accident, though he had bled but ſome few drops, did put a ſtop to his proceedings for ſome ſhort time to clean himſelf. Mean time,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62018:236"/>two Perſons were come to the <hi>Grotto,</hi> and had ſeated themſelves preſently after <hi>Repſet</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd himſelf.

From above, from below, from all ſides, there were a thouſand Springs, which put the two poor Lovers in ſuch a pickle, that it quite extinguiſh'd every ſpark of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62018:237"/>their amorous Fire, at leaſt for that time. They got out of the <hi>Grotto</hi> half drown'd, and blinded, every one ſhifting for themſelves, as alſo did <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> who was juſt entring the <hi>Grotto</hi> when the Squibs of Water began to play, ſo that he had his ſhare of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment alſo. <hi>Clorinetta</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the Walk, when ſhe heard the noiſe of the Water-works, and perceiv'd as well as ſhe could in the dark, ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons running, amongſt which one came up to her; <hi>Oh, are you there?</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am glad I have found you, we are ſurpris'd, let us get into the Lodge as faſt as we can by the ſame door we came out, if they have not ſhut it, from whence we will get into the ſtreet, thence to my Lodgings, where we will ſhift us.</hi> With that he pull'd <hi>Clorineta</hi> hard by the hand, with another that was wringing wet, and as
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62018:237"/>cold as a Ghoſt. <hi>Clorinetta,</hi> who had been frighted at this, did not know what to do, while ſhe was thinking whether ſhe had beſt to cry out, keep ſilent, diſcover her ſelf, or run from this Perſon that pull'd her along by force, but which was qualified ſometimes with a <hi>Come, Madam, there is no danger for us but in this place, and we are ſafe, if but once out of it.</hi> She was forc'd to yield to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's ſtrength, and to follow; he led her to the Gardiner's Lodge, where finding the door open, they got into the ſtreet, where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, a Footman coming by with a Light, <hi>Clorinetta</hi> did perceive that he belong'd to her; ſhe bid him to ſtay, calling him by his Name, then looking on the Perſon who held her by the hand, and that left a Train of Droppings where-e're he went. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>you may by this time,

When ſhe was got to the door, ſhe was ſtrangely ſurpris'd to ſee a brave Spark, with a young Lady in his hand, both in the ſame Condition with the other ſhe had ſo lately left. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid the Gentleman, <hi>by a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune this Gentlewoman and I have been put in this condition, and if You would be ſo obliging as to direct us to the</hi> Sultana<hi>'s Apartment, You would infinitely oblige us.</hi> This was <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> who having met with that Perſon, whom the other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who had taken <hi>Clorinetta,</hi> had loſt, and taking her for the <hi>Sultana,</hi> he was leading of her home, thinking to paſs her for one belonging to the <hi>Sultana.</hi> This

By this time the waſh'd Gentlewoman finding that the diſtruſt which ſhe had had all along, that ſhe had not the right Perſon by the hand, was on good grounds, was contriving how to get off, her Hoods, which the violence of the Water had forc'd over her Face,

With that ſhe diſingag'd her ſelf from <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> and deſiring to be excus'd, having made a Curtſy, ſhe went her way as faſt and as well as ſhe could, not knowing her ſelf where to go, nor how to diſpoſe of her ſelf. <hi>Chilaſe</hi> being left alone, <hi>Clorinetta</hi> offer'd the ſame Civility to him; but he, for fear of being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, would not accept of it, but ſhe would force it upon him, and the Lights being come, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her Man not to leave the Gentleman, till he was got to his Lodgings, and ſo ſhe retir'd to think on the ſtrange Adventures of that Night. <hi>Chilaſe</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with the Footman, gave him
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62018:239"/>a piece of Money, deſiring him to lead him to the next Inn, where he would take up for that night, he being very cold and wet, and his Lodgings too far off; which the Fellow readily perform'd, and went and told <hi>Clorinetta</hi> where he had left him, for ſhe long'd to know who that Perſon was; wherefore ſhe charg'd the Man to return to the Inn, and watch there all the reſt of the night till mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when he ſhould be reliev'd, and if that Perſon did go out to dodge him to his Lodgings, ſhe gave him ſomething to drink while he watch'd, and ſent him immediately away.</p>
                  <p>The Wet Lady had not gone far, but that ſhe fell into <hi>Repſet</hi>'s Hands, who did avoid, as well as he could, all perſons, for fear of being diſcover'd, he being in the <hi>Querpo</hi> Dreſs of his Order. He had loſt his way, and had been

She, who was for making all the haſte ſhe could poſſible to the Gardners, whoſe Daughter ſhe was, would hardly give him an anſwer, and ſhe purſuing her way, he took her by the hand and would follow her: He had done better to have ſaved himſelf that labour, for they were both met by the perſon who had brought firſt that Woman into the <hi>Grotto,</hi> ſhe told him that ſhe could not be rid of that Perſon, who was very troubleſome to her; at that, the Man, who was already vex'd at all the misfortune that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to his Miſtreſs, took the pains to lay a luſty Cudgel he had in his hand on <hi>Repſet</hi>'s ſhoulders, who run away as faſt as he could, crying out Murder with a full mouth: That noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62018:240"/>ſome perſons in the Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Houſe, who all this while had lain in a profound ſleep, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thinking, no more than their Maſter and Miſtreſs did, what had happen'd during their ſleep. The two Lovers hearing the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle that the Servants made in the Houſe, thought it was time to retire, and that made her yield to his importunities of going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, upon condition that he would marry her the next morning. Upon which Terms they agreed, and went their way, where he would lead her. The Gardiner's people having found nothing amiſs in the Houſe, and having reported ſo to the Maſter, who had begun to move, all was quiet again, and every body went to make an end of their Work in their Beds. Thus ended the odd Adventures of that croſs and ill condition'd Night, which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62018:241"/>been cut out for Lovers: We will leave all our Lovers to go to their Beds, not to ſleep, I dare ſay, but to reflect on the ſtrange Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conters that that Night had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, and return to <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> who all this while had been way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying of the <hi>Mufti Repſet.</hi> He had been inform'd, that he was frequently ſeen to go up the ſtairs which went to a paſſage in which was a back-door out of the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Chamber, ſo that theſe were the back-ſtairs to her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Servants to paſs by. Of truth the <hi>Mufti</hi> did often go up and down thoſe ſtairs, becauſe he had no other way to go to his Lodgings, which were one pair of ſtairs higher, and backwards, whereas the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Chamber was forwards. This Intelligence had ſo exaſperated <hi>Cha-abas</hi> anger againſt this wicked <hi>Mufti,</hi> which ſo diſturb'd an Emperour's quiet,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62018:241"/>that he reſolv'd upon watching himſelf, and ſurpriſe him going into the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Chamber, where he would give him that Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, which he deſerv'd. To this purpoſe, having diſguis'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under a long black Cloak, in which he muffled himſelf all over, he waited one night in a little by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, at the foot of the ſtairs, <hi>incognito,</hi> till his Spies ſhould bring him word of the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s getting up the ſtairs; but the late drub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing which <hi>Repſet</hi> had receiv'd, having caus'd him to keep his Bed, at leaſt his Chamber, for two or three days; for ſo long time was <hi>Cha-abas</hi> diſappointed alſo of his ſweet Revenge. But that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, one night as he was on the Watch, News were brought him that the <hi>Mufti</hi> was juſt gone up ſtairs, as he really was, <hi>Cha-abas</hi> muffles himſelf up, and up ſtairs he trudges after him, and as he
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62018:242"/>was earneſtly looking after him as he was getting up, he perceiv'd his own ſhadow againſt the Wall, caus'd by the Light that was plac'd above the ſtairs head; he took not time to examine, but being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt with having the <hi>Mufti</hi> in Chaſe, he takes it to be him, he fiercely runs after it, ſtill as he moves, that went on before him towards the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s back-door, till by <hi>Cha-abas</hi> coming nearer, it ſeem'd to go in, loſing it ſelf in the darkneſs which was betwixt the inmoſt and the outward door; at the ſight of which the Emperour making his laſt Efforts to reach him, ſtretching out his Arms to graſp him, he unfortunately ſtruck his Foot againſt a little Threſhold, which made him come down with all his ſtrength againſt the inward Wianſcote door, which with his force he made to flie open, and having at his ſtumble loſt his Hat
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62018:242"/>and Peruque, and got hold with both his Hands of the Cloak in which he was muffled; <hi>Have I got you,</hi> cryed he aloud, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering in what a poſture he was, nor where he was, <hi>You ſhall not ſcape me, now Prieſt,</hi> continued he.</p>
                  <p>The great noiſe which he had made with his Fall againſt the door and on the floor, had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who being lain on her Bed, did riſe, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what was the matter of thoſe Women that waited in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who ſtood all gazing on, not ſtirring a foot, in as great an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement as did the <hi>Sultana,</hi> not knowing all this while who this Perſon ſhould be, that ſo rudely durſt thus diſturb the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s reſt. Mean time, <hi>Cha-abas</hi> having recollected himſelf, and with all his fumbling under his Cloak, finding that he had loſt his prey,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62018:243"/>and in what a ſtrange poſture he was before the <hi>Sultana</hi> who ſtood ſtill looking on, and admiring what that Perſon ſhould be; he laps himſelf up in his long Cloak over Head and Ears, gets up, and without ſpeaking one word, got out of the Chamber down ſtairs, and retires to bemoan his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                  <p>All this while, the noiſe that <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had made with his haſty getting up ſtairs after the <hi>Mufti,</hi> had caus'd <hi>Repſet</hi> to ſtop when he was got to the ſecond pair of ſtairs, which were a little beyond the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Chamber-door, whence he had been looking all that while on the Scene which was acting below, and having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard the word <hi>Prieſt,</hi> which in the Emperour's paſſion he had ſpoke very loud; he ſeeing that Perſon gone, and that the Hat and Peruque, which had been thrown
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62018:243"/>from out of the Chamber into the paſſage, had been taken up by one whoſe Office it was to wait there, he gave him a little Money to let him have them, pretending he knew to whom they belong'd; and he retir'd with them to his Chamber to examine them more at leiſure, and to endeavour to find out who was the Owner of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cha-abas</hi> being got in private, after he had ſpent ſome time in muſing, he ſent for <hi>Monitenna</hi> to come and ſpeak with him; He told her, That ever ſince ſhe had imform'd him of his being Rival'd by <hi>Mufties,</hi> he had had an Eye on <hi>Repſet</hi>'s actions; That he had caus'd him to be obſerv'd, and that News being brought him of his frequent going up and down thoſe back-ſtairs, which led to the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Chamber, and ſo went on, telling her the diſaſter that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62018:244"/>had befallen him, concluding, that the <hi>Sultana</hi> had conceal'd him in her own Chamber, and ſav'd him from that puniſhment which he deſign'd him. To which ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <hi>That ſhe was at that very time, and had been for above an hour before in the</hi> Sultana's <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where I aſſure you, Sir, that the Mufti</hi> Repſet <hi>was not all that while,</hi> continu'd ſhe, <hi>and we were all ſo ſurpris'd with the noiſe and ſuddenneſs of the buſineſs, that all our thoughts were bent in knowing what was the matter, and who that Perſon ſhould be, that had made that diſturbance. Was I not known then,</hi> ſaid the Emperour? <hi>Not that I know,</hi> reply'd Monitenna, <hi>but ſome of us going to the door, and exquiring of ſome Perſon that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, what had been the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> He made Anſwer, <hi>That he knew not, more than that the Mufti</hi> Repſet <hi>having gone up ſtairs to his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62018:244"/>Lodgings, as he us'd to do, ſome body muffled up in a long black Cloak, had preſently after come up ſtairs, whether in purſuit of him they know not, but that this laſt Perſon, who he did not know, having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd his own ſhadow againſt the Wall, had fiercely run and catch'd after it, ſtill following it till it were loſt in the dark betwixt the two doors, that that Perſon had there fallen, and when he had got up again, and gone his way, he had left his Hat and Peruque behind him, which having been thrown out of the Chamber after him, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaid he did take them up, but that the Mufti</hi> Repſet, <hi>who from the other pair of ſtairs, having ſeen all that had paſs'd, did give him ſome money for them, pretending that he knew the Perſon to whom they did belong; that therefore he had let him have them: And are my things in the</hi> Mufti<hi>'s hands
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62018:245"/>then,</hi> reply'd Cha-abas, <hi>that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles me more than all the reſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I have not been known? My dear</hi> Monitenna, continu'd he, <hi>aſſiſt me in this buſineſs, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, I ſee, have decreed that I ſhould be perpetually oblig'd to thee, and I will certainly acknowledge it, if I get but once off of this buſineſs without being known; and that I have reveng'd my ſelf of theſe two</hi> Mufties, <hi>I think thou didſt name, as thou haſt promis'd me I ſhould. Be patient till then, Sir,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, <hi>and ſpoil not all by too much precipitation; I have promis'd it you, be patient then, and rely on my word, which I will make good with the firſt opportunity. But you muſt be ſure,</hi> ſaid Cha-abas, <hi>to get my Hat and Peruque out of</hi> Repſet<hi>'s hands, with all the expedition you can poſſible; for I fear very much, that by his ſhewing them up and down, they might at laſt be known
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62018:245"/>to be mine by ſome body or other.</hi> She aſſur'd him that ſhe would get them into her poſſeſſion that very night: After which they had other Diſcourſes mixt with ſome amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Expreſſions, which laſted till <hi>Monitenna</hi> thought it was time for her to retire, and ſee after the getting of thoſe things from <hi>Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She left the Emperour then, and retiring to her own Chamber, ſhe ſent thence one of the <hi>Sultana's</hi> Servants in the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Name, to demand from <hi>Repſet</hi> that Hat and Peruque which he had in his Hands, to which the <hi>Mufti</hi> made anſwer, That he had already ſent them by the firſt Meſſenger that the <hi>Sultana</hi> had ſent for them. The Perſon return'd to <hi>Monitenna</hi> with that Anſwer, which made her immediately to run to the <hi>Sultana's</hi> Apartment, to learn more of the buſineſs. There ſhe found
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62018:246"/>
                     <hi>Clorinetta,</hi> who was giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her laſt night Adventure to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> and how ſhe had found out that the Perſon, who was to be at the Aſſignation, was Mufti <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> how he had been ſerv'd by ſhe knew not who, but that the Gardener, who had loſt his Daughter that Night, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that he had lent the Key of the Water-works to the Mufti <hi>Repſet</hi> that very Night, only to make Sport, as he pretended, but that he believ'd he had an Hand in conveying his Daughter away, and that if ſhe was not ſuddenly reſtor'd to him, he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him to the King. <hi>Never were perſons, Madam, in ſuch a pickle,</hi> continu'd ſhe, <hi>as was the Mufti</hi> Chilaſe, <hi>the Gardener's Daughter and her Gallant; by good Fortune, the Mufti</hi> Repſet <hi>had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd his Favours on them before I came to the Rendezvous; I heard
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62018:246"/>the noiſe of the Water-works at a diſtance, which made me liſten, which prevented me of having my ſhare. How inſolent theſe</hi> Mufties <hi>are grown?</hi> ſaid the <hi>Sultana. You had no Diſcourſe with</hi> Chilaſe <hi>then?</hi> continu'd ſhe, <hi>None at all, Madam. I aſſure you I loſt the Happineſs of being courted by him,</hi> reply'd Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinetta: <hi>Well, 'tis no matter, the Sport we have loſt of that we have had another way. But how come you to know that this is the Emperour's Hat and Peruque?</hi> continu'd ſhe. <hi>Madam,</hi> reply'd Clorinetta, <hi>a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſon who knew that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was gone up theſe ſtairs in a Diſguiſe, and ſeeing him come down ſome time after without them, made ſome enquiry after them of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that waits in the paſſage, who denying that he had them, the other told him that they belong'd to the Emperour, to terrifie him, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to get them from him;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62018:247"/>which made him confeſs, that Mufti</hi> Repſet <hi>had them. A Servant of mine paſſing by heard this, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently came to tell it me as a great Secret.</hi> The <hi>Mufti</hi> made no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of delivering them to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; I ſent to him, ſaid the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana:</hi> it was anſwer'd, <hi>No,</hi> by ſome of her Servnats.</p>
                  <p>Thus did <hi>Monitenna</hi> learn, that it was known it was the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour who had given them that Larrum, and left thoſe ſigns of it behind him, but not one of them could gueſs at the right Cauſe, which had made him do that, till having recollected what the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that waited had ſeen, and what they themſelves had ſeen and heard: out of all they pickt out, that it was ſome Jealouſie that <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had of the Mufti <hi>Repſet</hi>'s going to ſee the <hi>Sultana</hi> that back-way, which had put the Emperour himſelf on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62018:247"/>of ſurpriſing him in the Fact. <hi>Monitenna</hi> had enough, ſhe flipt from the Company without being ſuſpected, and ſent word to the Emperour of all that had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Letter, which put him into ſuch a rage againſt every body, that none could have a free acceſs to him but <hi>Monitenna,</hi> who was become his right Hand. He ſent for her, ſhe came to him, and brought a long with her thoſe things which he had left behind him; and upon his asking her Advice, what he had beſt to do, ſhe advis'd him to trouble himſelf no further about it, that what was paſs'd could not be mended, and that the more he ſhould ſtir in it, the more noiſe it would make, and oblige people to pry the nearer into the buſineſs. <hi>What,</hi> ſaid he to <hi>Monitenna, and muſt thoſe two wicked audacious</hi> Mufties <hi>reſt unpuniſh'd, at leaſt let me know
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62018:248"/>the other Name alſo. Great Sir,</hi> anſwer'd Monitenna, <hi>if you will but put ſo much confidence in me, as to rely wholly on my care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the puniſhing both of</hi> Repſet <hi>and</hi> Chilaſe, <hi>thoſe two inſolent</hi> Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>you ſhall have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing it with your own Eyes, to your full ſatisfaction. I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on thee for that only, my dear Monitenna,</hi> reply'd Cha-abas, <hi>but in any thing elſe that thou ſhouldſt adviſe me, nay I will lay my life into thy hands. Then, Sir, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you,</hi> reply'd Monitenna, <hi>that within the ſpace of two days I will give you full ſatisfaction, as to your Revenge. That's all I deſire at preſent,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>I am pretty well weaned of thoſe deſires which I had towards the Lady</hi> Clorinetta, <hi>and the lowneſs of her mind, in her thoughts towards a</hi> Mufti, <hi>when ſhe was courted by an Emperour, has made me to turn all that good Will
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62018:248"/>and Eſteem which I had for her, into a perfect Love to thee, of which I ſhall daily make you ſenſible. As to the</hi> Sultana, <hi>I muſt confeſs that ſhe has ſtirr'd up in my Heart a very great eſteem for her; but if thou ſheweſt me that ſhe prefers ſo mean a Perſon to me, I ſhall no longer have any other regard for her, than what I owe and ought to pay to a</hi> Sultana <hi>under my Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiou.</hi> Divers other Diſcourſes paſs'd betwixt <hi>Cha-abas</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitenna,</hi> which were mixed with amorous Expreſſions; after which <hi>Monitenna</hi> retired, leaving the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in a much more quiet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind than ſhe had found him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chilaſe</hi> by this time had wip'd off all ſorrow; he had gone ſo far in the Diſcovery of the late night Adventures, as to learn that the Gardener had his Daughter ſtoln from him that night, that though
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62018:249"/>he had receiv'd his ſhare of the refreſhment which the Water-works had afforded, he believ'd that it was not intended for him, by reaſon that he was but juſt ſtep'd into the <hi>Grotto,</hi> and that he had ſeen and heard ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons run out of it, and paſs by him. He did not know but that the <hi>Sultana</hi> might be going towards that place, and prevented by the noiſe of the Waters and of thoſe Perſons that run away, and ſo have retired to her Apartment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; a ſign of it was, that when he thought that he had met with the <hi>Sultana,</hi> he had led her out of the Garden by her own door, which was found open, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had loſt the way after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in which he was the more confirm'd by meeting with the Lady <hi>Clorineta</hi> at that time, which he believ'd the <hi>Sultana</hi> might take along with her ſo far as into the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62018:249"/>Garden, where peradventure ſhe was to have ſtay'd till her return; thus did he run on in conſtruing all the accidents to his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and according as his Heart deſired they ſhould be. As for <hi>Repſet,</hi> he was left in the dark ſtill, ſtill tormented betwixt Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and Envy, in which he did all he could to clear and inform himſelf further; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he daily viſited <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> who had, as far as he knew himſelf, told him what had happened that Night, at which <hi>Repſet</hi> would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, but own nothing of that part which he had in it. <hi>Chilaſe</hi> was ſo prepoſſeſt and ſo poſitive, that the <hi>Sultana</hi> had been in the Garden, that <hi>Repſet</hi>'s Envy was the more kindled at it, which made him take the reſolution to have a finger in the Pye, though it were by ſurpriſe.</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:62018:250"/>
                  <p>One day as he was going into <hi>Chilaſe</hi>'s Lodgings, which were on the other ſide of the Garden, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Apartment, which made the way a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs about, a Perſon came to him, and ask'd him, if he was the Mufti <hi>Chilaſe; What would you have with him?</hi> reply'd Repſet, <hi>only deliver this Note; Sir,</hi> ſaid he, giving him the Note, <hi>and my buſineſs is at an end:</hi> So the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon preſently return'd the ſame way that he came. <hi>Repſet</hi> took the Note, obſerv'd the privacy with which the Meſſenger had deliver'd it, and upon this fancied that it was ſome ſecret buſineſs, which giving him the Curioſity to pry into it, he return'd back to his own Lodgings without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> where having ſhut himſelf in, he open'd the Paper, and found in it theſe Lines.</p>

                     <hi>Chilaſe</hi> had much to do to keep himſelf within his own bounds at the reading of this Note; he read it over and over, and kiſs'd it as often: <hi>Go,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>yes, through all the dangers that all Mankind and all the Devils in Hell could lay in my way, I would ſtep over them thus and thus, moſt charming Princeſs, to come to your Summons.</hi> Thus was he expreſſing his Courage and his Love when <hi>Repſet</hi> came into his Chamber without knocking, which had almoſt ſurpris'd <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſe</hi> paſt reprieve. So ſoon as he ſaw <hi>Repſet,</hi> he ſlided the Note into his Pocket, and perceiving that he had ſeen ſome of his Actions, and heard ſome of his Words; <hi>I was juſt repeating ſome words out of a Tragedy which affects me much,</hi> ſaid he. <hi>Well, what News,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>from beyond Sea? I have nothing new,</hi> reply'd Repſet, <hi>that is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; the</hi> Sultana, <hi>I believe, has
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62018:252"/>none neither to her mind, ſhe looks ſo ſowre and melancholick: I believe that a Nunnery would be the beſt place for her to retire in with her ſad and melancholick thoughts, with which ſhe diſobliges all the World but you. But me,</hi> reply'd Chilaſe, <hi>I had, 'tis true, a glimpſe of ſome hopes by an Aſſignation; but what did it come to? and what hopes have I had ſince? who have not heard one word more from her ſince that time. Thoſe great Perſons will take their own time,</hi> reply'd Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, <hi>and pleaſe their own humours; what you have not had yet, no doubt, you may expect; in ſhort, next time her inclinations move her, you ſhall hear from her. Not if ſhe has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſorrow,</hi> reply'd <hi>Chilaſe; That ebbs and flows, as Women pleaſe,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Repſet,</hi> after they have given a moments ſpace to thoſe troubleſom thoughts, <hi>they ſoon baniſh them from their Hearts,

Wait with patience and be happy in your great Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, while I muſt reſt contented with my meaner Fortune. Your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> reply'd Chilaſe, <hi>is certain, and you certainly happy in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, while I live only upon hopes and deſires.</hi> The two <hi>Mufties</hi> were enter'd into thoſe ſerious Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, far from either of their thoughts and deſigns, when that Word was brought in, that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality was come, who demanded to ſpeak with Mufti <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> which made the Mufti <hi>Repſet</hi> to retire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monitenna</hi> had engag'd in this her Deſign againſt the <hi>Mufties,</hi> a Perſon who was highly oblig'd to her, for having obtain'd for him a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62018:253"/>Favour from the Emperour; he was to bring along with him a Friend or two more to aſſiſt him; ſhe had inform'd them in every Circumſtance; ſhe had engag'd the two <hi>Mufties</hi> by the two Notes which ſhe had ſent, not doubting but that <hi>Repſet</hi>'s Jealouſie would oblige him to watch <hi>Monitenna,</hi> or his Envy and Malice towards <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> mixt with Love towards the <hi>Sultana,</hi> would make him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent his Rival's Happineſs, in interpoſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, either of which would ſerve her turn, though ſhe wiſh'd he might take the laſt Courſe. In fine, ſhe had fitted all things to her purpoſe, and all this with the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s approbation, and to <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineta</hi>'s knowledge, ſo far only as it concern'd <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> but not a word of <hi>Repſet</hi> had ſhe mention'd; ſhe had poſted her Friends in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Room, next to that in which
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62018:254"/>ſhe deſign'd to bring the two <hi>Mufties,</hi> as in the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, all was to be tranſacted in the dark, as if by the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Orders ſhe had advertis'd <hi>Cha-abas</hi> of the time, that he ſhould appear, and what he ſhould ſay, and ſhe her ſelf was to be their Conductor; ſhe had no more to do but to wait the hour, which was near at hand.</p>
                  <p>To give a better Colour to the buſineſs, and take off all Suſpicion on the <hi>Muftie</hi>'s ſides, the <hi>Sultana</hi> had quitted her own Chamber to <hi>Monitenna</hi>'s diſpoſal for that night, and was retired to her Cloſet with <hi>Clorinetta,</hi> to paſs the time at Cards till the Sport was ready; and <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had been diſpos'd of in the neareſt Pavillion in the Garden to the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>The hour being come, News were brought to <hi>Monitenna,</hi> that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62018:254"/>the Mufti <hi>Repſet</hi> did appear. There was no body ſtirring in the whole Apartment, and an obſcurity reign'd all over it, but in ſuch places as <hi>Monitenna</hi> had thought fit to enlighten with ſome ſmall Candles, with the help of one of them which ſtood at a low Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, was the <hi>Mufti</hi> diſcern'd. <hi>Monitenna,</hi> who was in a Dreſs which did ſufficiently diſguiſe her for a Woman belonging to the <hi>Sultana,</hi> came, and taking him by the Hand, <hi>I ſee you are pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>and rather a little before your time; Follow me,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſhe, <hi>and I'le lead you where you may be undreſſing your ſelf while I go to the</hi> Sultana, <hi>to learn when I ſhall bring you to her.</hi> With that ſhe led him into a little Room, where there was a Light, in which ſhe lock'd him up, and went to be ready to receive the other <hi>Mufti,</hi> whoſe Love would not let
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62018:255"/>him ſtay one moment beyond his time; ſhe accoſted him with Words much of the ſame Nature, and led him into another conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Room, where ſhe bid him undreſs himſelf, and prepare for to go along with her to the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi> ſo ſoon as ſhe ſhould receive the Orders from her ſo to do, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which ſhe was now going; ſhe ſhut him in alſo, and went to call that Woman who had infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her of the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s coming; ſhe bid her to follow her, and to take that Perſon by the Hand, which ſhe would give her in the dark, and to lead him very ſlowly into the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Chamber and to her Bed-ſide, where ſhe ſhould leave him and retire, locking the door after her; and that when ſhe was come to the Bed-ſide, ſhe ſhould pull the Curtain a little open. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus plac'd that Woman, ſhe went into the Chamber, where
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62018:255"/>ſhe put out the Candle, telling the <hi>Mufti,</hi> there would be no occaſion for one, and taking him by the Hand, ſhe led him in his Morning-Gown to the paſſage where the Woman was in the dark, and put him into her Hand, ſo run before through the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Chamber, took the other <hi>Mufti</hi> by the Hand, and led him haſtily to the other ſide of the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Bed, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard the ſign of the Curtain being drawn, ſhe left him: With what eagerneſs did thoſe two <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> pull off their Gowns to ſtep into the Embraces of a languiſhing <hi>Sultana!</hi> How were their Souls agitated with the very thoughts of the Enjoyments they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſurfeit with! How many different violent Paſſions did at once ſeize on their Spirits! Love, Fear, Reſpect, and Ambition were all ſtruggling at once, which ſhould have the Maſtery over
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62018:256"/>their Spirit; and the Contention was ſo equally great, that it was the Cauſe, neither of thoſe Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had the power to quite exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate their Spirits, and tranſport them beyond their natural bounds.</p>
                  <p>They ſtept into the Bed at the ſame time, with all the gentleneſs and reſervedneſs imaginable, and with trembling Hands, and aking Hearts, ſtretcht forth their Arms to feel out for the prey, they met one anothers Hand, and at the very firſt touch pull'd them back, as if each had met with a Viper, not without a ſtrange ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal, and both lay quiet a while after, which endeavouring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves better with their Legs, they approach'd them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle of the Bed, with as little ſatisfaction as they had receiv'd from their Hands, but with much more apprehenſions: At laſt the boldeſt of the two had
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62018:256"/>ſo much Courage as to lay his Hand on the others Face and Head, which having fully infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, that it was a man he had felt, and that having embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the other to do the ſame, as much by way of prevention or defence, as to ſatisfie any further his Curioſity, they at laſt through fear of danger, did ſeize one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo hard, that the ſmart caus'd them each to offend his Enemy as much as he could, in order to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves: theſe ſeiſing at laſt came to blows; and they were accompanied by words, and in the buſtle and confuſion of the Combat, holding ſtill one another very faſt with one Hand, while they laid on with the other, they at laſt both came down on the floor together. This being heard by <hi>Monitenna,</hi> ſhe preſently run to <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> and brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber, uſhering him
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62018:257"/>with two Flambaus in her Hands, at the ſight of which our obſtinate Combatants would not yield. <hi>Cha-abas</hi> ſeeing them thus all bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, their ſhirts half torn off of their Backs, and the few Hairs they had ſtrow'd over them; <hi>How now, Gentlemen,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>what do you do here in the</hi> Sultana<hi>'s Chamber at this time of the night, and in this poſture?</hi> They hearing the Emperour's Voice, turn'd all their late animoſity into ſhame and confuſion, each of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to recover their Night-Gowns, and to hide themſelves. <hi>I'le ſend ſome body to you to cool your Courage,</hi> ſaid Cha-abas, <hi>and when they have done their buſineſs; I'le give you another Viſit, mean time prepare your ſelves for the Mortification which is intended you.</hi> With that he went out of the Chamber, laughing heartily at them. <hi>Monitenna,</hi> who had left
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62018:257"/>one of the Lights in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, follow'd the Emperour, and lock'd the door upon them; and when ſhe had convey'd <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abas,</hi> where he might ſee and hear the ſecond Scene, and not be ſeen, ſhe went and brought the <hi>Sultana</hi> and <hi>Clorineta</hi> into the Chamber, that they might have a ſhare of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He muſt by all means take ſhare with him in his good Fortune.</hi> With that ſhe fell a laughting at them, but was not ſeconded in it by <hi>Clorineta,</hi> as ſhe had been at their
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62018:258"/>firſt coming in. She perceiving two, though they had ſo well muffled themſelves up in their Gowns, that their Faces were not to be known, had ſome certain apprehenſions, that ſhe might be too far concern'd in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the buſineſs to afford any ſhare of her Mirth to it, more than ſhe had done already. <hi>I hope,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd the <hi>Sultana, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour will reward his grave Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor for ſo noble an Attempt on the Perſon of a Princeſs that had ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd her ſelf under his generous and Royal Protection; and will not let his Companion, whoever he is, loſe his ſhare of the Recompence: May I not know who it is,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſhe, <hi>raiſing her voice, I muſt know to whom I am ſo much oblig'd for their Viſit, Who can inform me?</hi> This ſhe ſaid looking on <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenna.

                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:62018:258"/>anſwer'd Monitenna. <hi>Yes, Madam, I will ſpeak,</hi> ſaid then <hi>Repſet</hi> in a Tone that ſpoke nothing but Rage, Fury, and Deſpair, <hi>I am that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate</hi> Repſet, ſaid he, <hi>who had the Heart-breaking to receive a Note of this Aſſignation, which was intended for that Perſon, and tho' I found that it was not your Hand that had writ it, yet believing it to be a purſuance of that Intrigue, of which</hi> Chilaſe <hi>had made me his Confident; out of Envy to his good Fortune, and with a deſign to diſappoint him, I came thither, under the aſſurance of that Note, which had been deliver'd to me, which in the reading I found to be directed to him; and now let him anſwer for himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may imagine, or rather it cannot be imagin'd, into what a Conſternation this put poor <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinetta,</hi> not many days before ſhe had wiſh'd <hi>Repſet</hi> far enough from
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62018:259"/>diſturbing her new Amours with the Emperour; but ſo ſoon as ſhe had loſt all hopes of any further Converſation through his ſilence after thoſe unluckly Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which had happen'd to their Aſſignations, ſhe had recall'd her Love to <hi>Repſet,</hi> and was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that playing at a ſmall Game, was much better than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite out of Play, though it were but for the ſake of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. She therefore could not conceal ſo well her reſentments, but that notice was taken of them both by the <hi>Sultana</hi> and <hi>Moniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which oblig'd the <hi>Sultana</hi> to retire ſooner than ſhe intended, who was followed by <hi>Clorinetta</hi> and <hi>Monitenna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No ſooner had the <hi>Sultana</hi> ſet a ſtep towards her retiring, but that thoſe Perſons who had been appointed by <hi>Monitenna</hi> to play their parts, came into the Room,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62018:259"/>they had been waiting ſome time for the <hi>Sultana's</hi> retreat, they came up to the two <hi>Mufties,</hi> and taking faſt hold of them in a kind of rough way, told them that by Order from the Emperour, they came to remove their ſtation into another place; they led them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Room, where the door being ſhut upon them, they had leiſure to conſider that there were two or three men more who look'd like Surgeons, with Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-Knives, Razors, Sciſſers, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Rowlers, and ſuch like things on a Table before them; then caſting their looks towards the Chimney, they ſaw Searing-Irons in the fire. Theſe things of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſpoke terrour enough to the Criminals, and doubtleſs they were apprehenſive that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd a puniſhment proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſuitable to their Crimes, in which they were preſently
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62018:260"/>confirm'd, when one of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons ask'd thoſe Perſons that had brought them in, <hi>Whether thoſe were the two Perſons that were to be made Eunuchs? Yes,</hi> reply'd the two other; <hi>Then aſſiſt us to bind them,</hi> ſaid the Surgeons, <hi>that we may obey the Emperour's Orders, who has declar'd, that he would have us ſerv'd ſo, if we obey not his Commands to a tittle.</hi> With that, all thoſe that were in the Room, came about the two poor <hi>Mufties,</hi> as with a deſign to bind them. When they both ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to oppoſe with all their violence the ſeverity of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, pleading both, That they had been trepan'd; That it was a deſigned Plot to put a ſignal Affront upon the whole Clergy in their particular Perſons, and that they were to be put into Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hands to be puniſh'd, if guilty, but that they knew not
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62018:260"/>any fault that they were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of. Thus did the terrour of the puniſhment reconcile in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment two Perſons who but a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute before were declar'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: They were anſwer'd, That their very being at ſuch an unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable hour in that Undreſs in the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Chamber, could not but ſpeak them guilty; and upon that, the Surgeons came up nearer to them, as with Cords in their Hands, with a deſign to bind them. When <hi>Repſet,</hi> who was the moſt valiant of the two, and neareſt the fire, ſtoopt on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and taking up two of the red-hot Irons out of the fire, he gave one to <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Here, take this in your defence, and let us die bravely, and ſell our lives as dear as we can, rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure tamely that horrid Torment that theſe cruel Hang-men would inflict upon us. Let them not unman
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62018:261"/>us, but let us die like men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſudden and deſperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in <hi>Repſet,</hi> which had been embrac'd alſo by <hi>Chilaſe,</hi> who had been rendred couragious by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſet the others on retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſteps, and enter into a Conſultation, the reſult of which was, That the two Delinquents ſhould deſire that one of them ſhould be ſent to the Emperour, to humbly remonſtrate to Him of the one hand, that they were both alur'd into this <hi>Praemunire;</hi> to which they conſented, ſaying, <hi>That the one had but obey'd the</hi> Sultana<hi>'s Command, and the other but deſign'd to break his meaſures; That this force us'd againſt two Perſons of ſuch eminent Ranks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Clergie, was a too great intrenching on their Prerogatives; And on the other, that rather than yield to ſo ſevere a puniſhment, they would die, though they ſhould be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62018:261"/>forc'd to kill themſelves, if they could not overcome their Enemies, unto whom they would ſell their lives as dear as they could.</hi> Theſe Inſtructions being deliver'd to Perſons that had no further Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, than to affright them to the laſt extremity, were ſufficient to ſet them going to the Emperour. Mean time there was a Ceſſation of Arms, and a further Parley betwixt the two Parties, in which abundance of things were ſaid on both ſides; yet all this while nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party knew one another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, nor ſo much as the Names of any Perſons, and the two <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62018:263"/>both into moſt violent Feavers, in which the Mighty French <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naceas</hi> for all Diſeaſes, Clyſters, Julips, and Bleedings were not wanting, and if that cure them not, they are as ſurely doom'd to Death, as any of our Ruſticks are when no amendments appears af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the advantageous uſe of a Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Poſſet. <hi>Chilaſe</hi> was the firſt which was reckon'd out of danger, yet he had a lingring Feaver on him for a long time. But <hi>Repſet</hi> being of a more fiery diſpoſition, the fuel of his Feaver laſted longer before it had ſpent it ſelf, inſomuch that he was almoſt brought to the laſt gaſp: Yet at laſt through a ſight which he had got of <hi>Clori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netta,</hi> who had ſolicited the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> to ſend her to him with an <hi>How do you?</hi> He began to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver little by little, but remain'd ſo long weak, and ſo oppreſs'd with Melancholy, that he ſtirr'd
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62018:264"/>not out of his Chamber in two months time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cha-abas</hi> was infinitely pleas'd with <hi>Monitenna,</hi> for having given him ſo Comical a diverſion and revenge, in which there had been ſo much terrour, and ſo little hurt, and the Reputation of both the <hi>Mufties</hi> ſecur'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of their Names and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under Diſguiſes. <hi>Monitenna,</hi> mean time, did triumph within her ſelf, for having at once ſo bravely reveng'd her ſelf of all her Enemies, and ingratiated her ſelf ſo far into <hi>Cha-abas</hi> Favour again, as not to be remov'd from thence in haſte by any new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender.</p>
                  <p>Things were in that amorous and diverting poſture in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Court, when News came from divers parts of <hi>Cha-abas</hi> ill Succeſs againſt thoſe Confederate Princes that were reſolv'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62018:264"/>their Rights, which <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had baſely taken, and with the ſame injuſtice with-held from them. But if he was beaten, and forc'd to ſurrender thoſe places that he had formerly ſurpris'd, he would be ſure to level them firſt, to blow up all publick Edifices, to ſet fire on every place, not ſparing the very Churches, and even to dig up the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the City-walls. This was done always in cold blood, after they had ſatiated themſelves with Raviſhments and horrid Murders. All this under pretence to leave the Country ſo deſolate, as that their Enemies ſhould not be able to ſubſiſt in it; though it was well known, that it was but with a deſign to animate and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his men, who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the unjuſtice of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Cauſe, would frequently take all opportunities of deſerting
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62018:265"/>ſo cruel and bloody a Maſter, to adhere to ſuch perſons as with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice proſecuted a generous War againſt that general Enemy of Mankind. Of truth his Cruelties were ſuch, that thoſe few of his Allies, who had at firſt ſtuck to him, abandon'd him, having not the Heart to aſſiſt a Perſon that had ſo wholly given himſelf up to the ruine and deſtruction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>Neither was he more ſucceſsful in <hi>Leridan.</hi> His Army there, which though joyned with that of the Natives of that Kingdom, which though very cruel againſt the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> was ſo out-done in thoſe barbarous Acts by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that they began to fear the falling under their Tyranny. They did not ſtick to declare this, and to confeſs that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continue to live under the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Yoke, than to be made
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62018:265"/>Slaves to the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and when they were told by the <hi>Perſian</hi> Officers, that thoſe <hi>Mahometans,</hi> with whom they prefer'd to live rather than under them, were Hereticks, they boldly anſwer'd, that ſo was their Emperour and themſelves alſo, for having made War againſt the Grand <hi>Mufti,</hi> and declaring him not infallible, which Tenet, ſaid they, none but He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks would hold: Beſides, they highly murmur'd at the ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which they had in all their Undertakings, at the loſs of ſo many brave men before ſo mean a place as was <hi>Lynderodon;</hi> now that they could not effect any thing with their Golden Batteries, as they had formerly done in other places. Theſe Complaints of the <hi>Leridians</hi> to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced nothing but Grudges and Heart-burnings betwixt them, which amongſt the Officers on both
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62018:266"/>ſides, after having reproach'd one another of want of Courage, came to quarrels, which ended in blows and Duels, in which commonly the <hi>Perſians</hi> came by the worſe. While that the common Souldiers did daily deſert, retiring in their Faſtneſſes and Retreats, where they bid defiance to the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mahometans</hi> mean time, kept themſelves in ſtrong Holds, and with unſpeakable Valour did oppoſe their Enemies, daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a very conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from <hi>Albiona</hi> and <hi>Clonſtad.</hi> Eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Lynderodon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Valour, that they, in divers Sallies, did kill and take ſo many, both Officers and Souldiers of their Enemies, that they were forc'd to raiſe the Siege, and to retire at ſuch a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from that place with their Army, that theſe brave <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:62018:266"/>remain'd Maſters of the Field ten miles round them.</p>
                  <p>The Winds proving contrary, during a long time, for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of thoſe Men and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition which were ready to go, as it is uſual at that ſeaſon of the year. The Fleet appointed to carry them, put divers times to Sea, but as often were driven back again by Weſterly, Nother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Northweſt Winds.</p>
                  <p>In the Kingdom of <hi>Clonſtad,</hi> the principal Fortreſs was ſurrendred at diſcretion, and all thoſe that had taken up Arms for <hi>Amurat,</hi> were beaten and diſpers'd, divers Packets of Letters, Inſtructions and Commiſſions ſent by <hi>Amurat</hi> from <hi>Leridan,</hi> to thoſe of his Party in <hi>Clonſtad,</hi> were diſcover'd, the Perſons ſeiz'd and impriſon'd, their Papers brought to the Grand Council of that Nation, read and examined, whereby all the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:62018:267"/>Deſigns and private Plots at that time in agitation in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, were laid open and detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; upon which divers, of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now were the <hi>Ottoman</hi> and <hi>Haldonian</hi> Fleets joyn'd at Sea, which made <hi>Cha-abas</hi> Fleet to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it ſelf; part of it was ſent by him to annoy and deſtroy ſome of the <hi>Ottomans</hi> and <hi>Haldonians</hi> Plantations in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the reſt was kept in their Harbours, not daring to ſtir forth, but watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying ſome Recruits of Men, Arms, and Ammunitions into <hi>Leridan,</hi> which was almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to do the direct way, becauſe the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62018:267"/>lay in the Chanel. He likewiſe ſent ſome Ships with Relief for <hi>Leridan,</hi> whoſe Officers were to ſteer their Courſe quite another way, to ſuch an appointed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, where they were to open their Commiſſions, and then they were order'd to ſteer round, and to land in <hi>Leridan,</hi> where they could moſt conveniently, not to be moleſted by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fleet.</p>
                  <p>But if that <hi>Cha-abas</hi> had ſuch Deſigns on <hi>Leridan,</hi> which King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of truth he had bought very dear, and for which he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſome years ſince, made divers conſiderable Payments, and which was yet to coſt him much more Money and mens Lives, before he could be abſolute Maſter of it, if ever he did get it. <hi>Solyman</hi> and his Grand Council of the <hi>Divan</hi> were not wanting on their parts to ſupply the two Kingdoms of <hi>Clonſtad</hi> and <hi>Leridan</hi> with all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62018:268"/>to ſuppreſs all the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> Plots and Machinations, to diſarm them, ſeize them from amongſt them that were the moſt forward in broaching of falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, in diſperſing of libellous and treaſonable Papers, and in ſowing of Sedition and Rebellion amongſt the Mobile. Divers of them were ſeiz'd, ſitting in their dark Councils, ſome in diſperſing of falſe and forg'd Proclamations and Declarations, under <hi>Amurat</hi>'s Name, and others in buying of Arms, and making great Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in order to a Rebellion. Theſe Arms were diſcover'd, ſeiz'd on, and ſecur'd, and the Gaols were fill'd with thoſe ſeditious <hi>Haliſts.</hi> Thus by the Emperour's Vigilance, and the Grand Council of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empires wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, all their miſchiefs were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and all things tended to a perfect Peace and Settlement of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62018:268"/>the whole Empire; inſomuch that thoſe who ſat at the Helm, thought fit to give <hi>Cha-abas</hi> ſome diverſion, and to attack him by Sea, while the reſt of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were proſecuting of the War againk him by Land.</p>
                  <p>To that purpoſe there were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns laid of going with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the united Fleets before that Haven where <hi>Cha-abas</hi> Fleet lay at Anchor, and there, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhould ſerve, and as they ſhould think moſt convenient, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſend a conſiderable number of Fire-ſhips in amongſt them all at once, and ſo burn and deſtroy them in their Harbour, or elſe block them up in it, ſo as that they might not be able to get out, by ſinking divers old Carcaſſes of Ships laden with ſtones at the mouth of the Harbour.</p>
                  <p>It was alſo deliberated, That during that Diverſion a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62018:269"/>Army ſhould be landed thereabouts, to ſeize on the Forts, Caſtles, and other ſtrong Holds that were the Guards of that Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Theſe things and divers others of the ſame Nature, were debated, and ſome concluded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſhew'd that all things were in good poſture in the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, ſince that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan from being wholly on the defenſive to undertake their part of an offenſive War with the reſt of their Allies againſt <hi>Cha-abas,</hi> that univerſal Enemy of Mankind, and of the true, ancient, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> Religion.</p>
                  <p>Thus far did my Memoirs reach, from whence I have taken that matter, of which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the firſt and ſecond Part of the <hi>Court Secret.</hi> May the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, ruine, and total deſtruction of the <hi>Ante-Titus Veſpaſianus</hi> of
